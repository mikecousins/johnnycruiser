    <p>It had been 7 years since we last went to Alaska, so we decided  it was
	time to visit there again. Marjorie found a Celebrity Millennium cruise
	that offered TA rates so we picked that one.  The cruise had several 
	positives other than the cruise itself - a chance to do the railroad from
	Anchorage to Seward, a new port (Icy Strait Point), and a chance to see
	a "Solsticized" Millennium class ship. We had done the Constellation 
	(3 times) and the Infinity, but that was before the upgrades. The
	only nagging doubt about the cruise was that Chrissy was due
	Aug 8 or 9 (first grandchild!) and we would not be home until Aug 1. Should be lots
	of time!</p>
	  <p>The ship was wonderful. The upgrade had added 60 additional 
	  cabins (120 pax) but even with 2359 passengers aboard it didn't feel crowded.
	  We tried the new Bistro on Five and it was a good as on the Solstice class.
	  The reason I only gave 4 stars to the food (which was excellent) is because
	  king crab is no longer offered, even on an Alaskan cruise! The internet
	  was the best we have ever encountered. It was fairly quick and we didn't
	  even consume all of our free 90 minutes each. The gym was newly
	  refurbished with new equipment including both a Model D and a Model 
	  E Concept II rower.</p>
	  <p>The food was wonderful with the exception of no king crab. We did all 
	  dinners in the MDR as well as several breakfasts and lunches. At dinner we
	  did our "nab a drink" trick ordering a free beer / wine at the Elite happy hour
	  and carrying it down to the dining room. Suprisingly, this was a non-trivia
	  cruise crowd. There were maybe 20 people max who showed up. Marjorie 
	  and I played as a team of two and sometimes one or two others would join us.
	  <p>The weather was the poorest we have had in Alaska. In the past we have had many 
	  sunny, warm days (very lucky!!) but this time it was typical Alaska weather - cool 
	  and rainy. Folks doing a B2B with the
	  previous sailing got a week of warm (70's) sunny days. We missed it by a week.
	  This didn't dampen our spirits though.

		  Marjorie was working today. I left home at 3:30 PM. I picked up our dinner from subway
		  (lobster sandwiches!!) and then retreived Marjorie from the City Hall at 4:20. We were to the 
		  airport by about 4:40. We parked in Park & Jet lot and shuttled to terminal. We
		  checked in and then ate our lobster  sandwiches in the departures lobby.
		 Afterwards we went through customs and security and on to the waiting room. 
		 Our flight was about 1/2 hour late. It was about 7:30 PM when we finally  left for Seattle.
		 We were in Seattle by 8:00. Our next flight to Anchorage was supposed to board at 
		  8:15, but fortunately it was at a closeby gate and also delayed a bit so we made 
		  connection easily. (And so did our luggage!).
		  We landed in Anchorage by 11:30 PM. We got  our
		  luggage, phoned the Coast Hotel for their shuttle and were in our room by 12:30 (2:30 YYC time). 
		  The hotel was right by the airport so it was only a 5 minute shuttle. We were glad to get to bed!

        <h3>Day 1 (Jul 25) - Boarding in Seward</h3>

      <img src="images/diary_alaska_0714/photo_alaska_0714_04.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
		We were up at 8:30. Breakfast wasn't included, but there was an excellent 
		breakfast served at the hotel restaurant. I had a delicious crab omelet with sausages 
		and toast for $15. After breakfast we wandered around the local area and picked 
		up a 12 pack of Coke at a gas station convenience store. Just minutes from the hotel 
		was a small lake that was surrounded by float planes. We checked out at 11:00 
		and took cab to the Alaska Railroad Station (about 20 minutes, $17) to catch 
		our 1:00 PM train to Seward (as instructed by Celebrity). We had prebooked 
		the train transfer with Celebrity before the cruise. We didn't stay in the 
		Celebrity recommended hotel (Marriot) and so we didn't qualify for the hotel luggage 
		service and bus transfer to the station. Any way, at the station the ticket agent didn't 
		know anything about our 1:00 PM train. (Oh, oh!) It turned out that there was a train station 
		right in the airport terminal building and that was where we should have been! Arrrgh! 
      <br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_alaska_0714/photo_alaska_0714_05.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_alaska_0714/photo_alaska_0714_06.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	<p>As luck would have it, though, there was a busload of Celebrity passengers milling 
	around who had also been dropped off at this "wrong" station by an unknowing bus 
	driver. They were waiting for a bus to transfer them back to the airport. So, we joined 
	them and were bused back past our hotel and to the airport. Of course we were the only 
	ones with luggage as the others had yielded theirs at their hotel. At the airport the 
	staff took our luggage and put it in a corner. We had no idea how the luggage was being 
	shipped to Seward. They had cruise checkin booths set up in the
	terminal so we got our room key right 
	there at the airport. The train was waiting for us and we had only a short wait to 
	board. As we boarded we looked back at our lonely bags and said good bye to them. The 
	train ride was lovely. It was overcast and a bit rainy, but that didn't really spoil 
	the view. We sat with a nice couple (Bob and Kathy) from Cincinatti. The train trip was 
	about 4 	hours and we arrived in Seward at 5:00 PM. 
      <br clear=left>

      <img src="images/diary_alaska_0714/photo_alaska_0714_08.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	At the ship we only needed to do security as we already had 
	our room keys, so boarding was very quick. We visited our cabin quickly (no bags had 
	been delivered yet) and 
	then went to dinner. Almost everyone was in their grubbies as not many bags had been 
	delivered yet. Forgetting about the fate of our bags, I had an excellent prime rib. 
	After dinner my small bag and Marjorie's 
	main bag were delivered (whew!) but not my main bag. The status of our final bag was explained
	by our flashing cabin phone.There was a phone message that I 
	had to report to deck one for a further exploration of my bag. Oh dear, what now. There 
	were mobs of people there being stripped of booze and ulu knives. I think the item in my bag
	was the long scissors in my toiletries bag. However the security guy couldn't find 
	anything bad in my bag so I was released unscathed. I had to drag my own bag back to
	the cabin. We didn't do the entertainment and went to bed early.

    <p>Today was a day at sea including a sailby of the Hubbard Glacier in the afternoon.
	We were up at 7:30 to find that there was no hot water, and the cold water was brown!  The
	cabin steward said it was a plumbing problem and was affecting 3 decks. The problem 
	was fixed in a couple of hours. We checked out the special Elite breakfast lounge but
	weren't impressed with the selection so we went to the MDR. Afterwards we went to the 
	future cruise desk to (what else!) book a Transatlantic cruise. Then Marjorie went to a 
	port lecture and I went to the gym. Our Cruise Critic get together was at 12:00 and we did 
	lunch in the MDR right after.We entered Yakatuk Bay around 2:00 and arrived at the 
	Hubbard Glacier
	soon after. Because there weren't many ice chunks in the water, we were able to get within
	1/2 mile of the glacier - the closest they had been this season. There were several  loud
	explosions of ice (calving) tumbling into the ocean. The temperature dropped way down 
	and I was wearing my mitts and toque. We left the bay about 4:00 PM and entered back
	into the open water. It was formal night so I had rack of lamb for dinner. We skipped the 
	entertainment..

      <p>We woke up at 7:00 to a cloudy, rainy day. We had booked a mid-morning private tour with
	  Captain Larry who we had used before. We went up on deck to see us come into Juneau. 
	  We had breakfast in the buffet and then went ashore to shop a bit. Marj wanted some wooden 
	  "bear paw" salad servers. We were back on board by 10:30 to drop off our goodies and then headed
	  back ashore to our 11:00 whale watching tour. We were bused about 13 miles to Auke Bay where
	  the boat was docked. We were on the boat and leaving the harbour by 12:00. It was still cloudy with 
	  some wind and rain. Our first treat was a pod of twenty or so orcas that put on a show for us. Some of them
	  had very large dorsal fins. Further out we came upon a group of ten or so humpback whales doing 
	  bubble feeding. We really enjoyed the trip! We were bused back to town and were back to the ship 
	  by 3:30. We were dropped off at a different dock (Island Princess) and had an enjoyable short
	  walk back to our own dock. It was even a bit sunny! Marjorie wandered some more around the town while 
	  I went to the trivia. There were only a few people there and I played as a team of one. I finished 
	  tied for second. For dinner I had roast turkey. The entertainment was a juggler who was excellent.
	  When we got back to our room we had a phone message waiting that we had won a tour of the
	  engine control room on the final sea day. Woohoo!

    <p>We woke up at 6:30 to another cool, cloudy, rainy day. (Back home in Calgary it 
	was supposed to hit 37 today). The ship was already docked.We had breakfast in 
	the buffet and then headed off to our 8:15 dog sledding excursion, booked through 
	the ship. We drove about 15 miles out of town to a meadow at the base of a mountain.
	We walked across the marshy meadow and then boarded a Unimog to take us up a steep
	gravel road to the dog racing area high up the mountain side. There we boarded 6 
	passenger wheeled "sleds" and 16 dogs raced us several times around a 1/2 mile
	track (ie. dirt road). We drove back down the mountain to the base camp where we 
	got a lecture on the Iditerod race, including an actual racing sled. Then we got to play 
	with the puppies. They really encourage human interaction to socialize the puppies.
	Then it was back across the meadow, onto the bus and back to the ship by 12:00.
	We had lunch at the Bistro on 5 (crepes). Marjorie headed back into Skagway to
	walk around while I read for a while and then went to the gym. For dinner I had a
	lamb shank that was done like pulled pork. Very good! We skipped the entertainment.
	<p><i><b>Note:</b> Having booked "anytime dining", we were seated each night 
      with different folks in the anytime dining area. However, this evening we 
      were seated at a table for 8 that was an overflow table from the fixed seating 
      area. There were 6 early dining folks and 2 empty chairs. We really enjoyed 
      this group and they asked us to join them for the rest of the evenings.

    <p>We were up at 7:00 with nothing planned for the day. Once again it was cool and rainy.
	This was our first visit to this port, which is really just an indian village.  It was also the only 
	tender port of the trip. The highlights are the renovated cannery, the indian village and a
	"one leg" zip-line that weighs in at 5300 feet (just over a mile). Considering it was $139 for 
	45 seconds of thrill we decided against the zip-line. After tendering over we wandered 
	through the cannery. There were some interesting craft stores and the museum was very 
	interesting. We walked along the beach to where the zip-liners were landing and watched 
	then for a bit. We did not take the shuttle bus to the indian village. Some people enjoyed 
	the village and some didn't. It depends if you enjoy other cultures or not, I guess. As it
	was cool and drizzling, we tendered back to the ship for lunch. We read a bit after lunch 
	and then I headed to the gym. We attended a short Galapagos lecture at 4:00 and an Alaskan
	natural history lecture at 4:30. The sun was out after the lecture - nice to see it! We read
	for a bit and then met Bob and Kathy for dinner in the MDR (we did notify our fixed dining 
	compatriots that we had another appointment). I had braised spare ribs 
	which were delicious. The entertainment were a gymnastic couple 
	(Jocka and Maria) who had done a
	contract with Cirque de Soleil. They did some awesome floor stuff and then some "silk"
	manuevers. They were excellent. Some of the accompanying music was from
	"Allegria", so I guess that was the C'd'S  show that they had done.

    <p>We got up at 7:00 to another cool, rainy day. That's Alaska! We had beento Ketchikan several times
	before so this time we had nothing planned. We had breakfast in the MDR and then headed 
	off the ship to walk around the town. We had never walked the Creek Street area, so that's where we 
	headed. There were lots of interesting art and souvenir shops as well as some museums. Then
	we walked into the main part of town and did a bit of shopping. I bought a jigsaw puzzle and
	Marjorie bought a 15 cent 2015 calendar. I headed back onto the ship at 10:30 while Marjorie
	did some more wandering around. On board, I went up to the gym. Marjorie arrived back on
	board and we went to the buffet for lunch. A bit of sun came out so we disembarked again to
	enjoy the waterfront. We walked past the famous tunnel and quite a ways along the wharfs and 
	piers. Having "done the town" we were back on the ship by 3:00 for some read time. We went
	to trivia at 4:00 and won some expensive Celebrity playing cards. It was formal night and we
	rejoined our fixed dining table for dinner. I had lamb chops. They were very good. We skipped
	the entertainment. Our clocks went ahead an hour tonight in preparation for Vancouver.

    <p>We woke up at 7:30 just as we were sailing into Canadian waters. And, just 
      like that, out came the sun. It was sunny and warm for the rest of our trip! 
      Today would be spent travelling across Queen Charlotte Sound and then down 
      the length of Vancouver Island. We had breakfast in the MDR and then read 
      a bit on our balcony. At 10:15 we attended "nautical trivia" where we won 
      some valuable luggage tags. This was followed by general trivia where we 
      won some exquisite Celebrity tote bags. We were on a roll! At 11:40 we headed down to deck 
      one to meet the group doing the engine control room tour. The control room 
      was very interesting, with video monitors showing the various diesel and 
      gas engines and the azipod motors. The chief engineer explained how everything 
      worked. When running at cruising speed (about 18 knots) the main engines 
      consume 21 gallons (73 litres) of gas per minute! After the tour we had 
      lunch in the buffet where we consumed several pounds of food per minute.

	  <p>At 2:00 there was a talk / demo session with Jocka 
      and Maria (the gymnasts - this time in their grubbies). It was really interesting 
      to hear about their life in show business. They did a number of their "moves" 
      for us explaining what they went through learning to do them. What a rigorous 
      life!  After the demo Marjorie headed off to who knows where and I went up to the gym. The first day that
	  I went to the gym it was packed. Since then, I have only encountered 5 or 6 people each time. Where 
	  did they go? Being time to relax, Marjorie and I sat out on the balcony (starboard side) 
	  in the warm sun watching the east coast of Vancouver island. The scenery was gorgeous. I had
	  forgotten just how mountainous the island was. We passed many towns / villages / settlements along
	   the way. It was surprising how many people lived along the coast. We could only guess which towns 
	   we were passing, but Campbell River was quite obvious. Late in the afternoon Marjorie checked our 
	   email and there was a note from Christina saying that she was about to be induced
	   today or tomorrow. Oh no! There was nothing we could do though as we weren't flying home
	   until tomorrow afternoon. For
	   dinner I had BBQ chicken with a side of Mac&Cheese from the kid's menu. Yummy. We skipped
	   the entertainment and packed our bags instead. We tossed our larger bags out into the hallway
	   and headed to bed.

    <p>We were up at 5:30, wondering about the status of our grandson. It was 
      a gorgeous day in Vancouver. We hustled to the upper deck to witness going 
      under the Lion's Gate Bridge at 6:00. Stanley Park was beautiful in the 
      morning sun. We had breakfast in the buffet as we watched the docking at 
      Canada Place. After watching the dock activity from our balcony, we finally 
      left tour cabin for our 8:15 departure time. We exited the ship and picked 
      up our luggage from the terminal area. Then it was through Customs and out 
      of the terminal. We walked the 3 blocks to the Marine Building, then downstairs 
      to the Canada Line station. The train to the airport was quite quick (25 
      minutes) and we were through checkin by 9:00 AM. We wandered around the 
      airport for a while and spent some time reading in the new observation lounge. 
      We tried getting in to the White Spot for lunch at 10:00, but they were 
      only serving breakfast then. At 11:00 we headed back to White Spot for lunch. 
      After lunch we went through security and onto our 1:00 flight to Calgary. 
      We landed at 3:30, picked up our luggage, shuttled to the parking lot and 
      were home by 5:00 PM. It was another great cruise. 
	  <p><i><b>Note: </b>We checked 
      on the status of Christina and she was at the hospital, induced, and moving 
      right along. The baby was born just after 7:00. Mike and Stacy brought us 
      Minnie (to look after for a week) and Marjorie's school friend Julia (and 
      Alex and future DIL Jenny) dropped in to stay the night. So much for cleaning 
      up the house from 5 cats!</i> <br clear=right>
