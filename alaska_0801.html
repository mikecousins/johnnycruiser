      <p>In early 2001, I received a call at work saying that I had won an Alaskan cruise for  2.  
	  Until then, cruising was the farthest thing from our minds and we had never seriously 
	  considered taking one. Our minds changed very quickly, and we enthusiastically
	  booked a week aboard the Sea Princess. Here's how it turned out.
	<center><h3>Day 1 (Aug 11) - Boarding in Vancouver</h3></center>
	  <img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_01.jpg" align="right" border="0">
<p>We booked our air travel through Princess. Instead of flying us direct from Calgary to Vancouver (1 hour flight),
	they flew us to Seattle (1.5 hours) and then bused us to Vancouver (another 4 hours). We were the last
	people to board the ship, just before the 5 PM sailing. I don't know how they figured that this
	was the most economical way to get us there!</p>
	<p>We immediately went to our cabin to check it out. We had booked an outside cabin (porthole window), but were
	mysteriously upgraded to a balcony. What a treat!. We headed up to the upper deck for the sail-away party.
	Just after 5 PM, we sailed out through English Bay. The evening sun was shining on the harbour. What a start to our
	cruise.
    <br clear=right>
	<center><h3>Day 2 (Aug 12) - Cruising the Inside Passage</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_02.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	When we arose the next morning, it was very foggy. The fog stayed with us for most of the day, clearing up only in the evening.
	This was a day at sea. While wandering around on the top deck in the fog, we were introduced to the fog horn. 
	Wow, is it ever loud!. It was a good day to explore the ship. I was like a little kid checking out the ship - running up and down 
	the decks exploring every nook and cranny. The ship was really amazing with so many lounges
	and public spaces. Crusing was looking pretty good!</p>
	<p>Princess is the only line we've been on that has a 24 hour buffet. It was great as we were up on deck by 6AM each morning,
	and could get a full breakfast right away.  Another anomaly is this is the only ship we've sailed that has the buffet area at the front of the ship 
	and the fitness center at the back.
    <br clear=left>
	<center><h3>Day 3 (Aug 13) - Ketchikan, Alaska</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_03.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	On Day 3, we awoke to blue skies and sunshine. This was to last for several days. By 6 AM we were headed into the port of Ketchikan.
	We had booked a ship's tour of the city for the morning, which included a trip out of
	town to a reconstructed Indian village.  The trip was very interesting.
	In the afternoon, we just wandered around the town. </p>
	<p>Ketchikan is built up the slopes of the mountain. Some of the
	roads are actually on platforms built out from the hill. A few of the "roads" heading up the slope were marked on the map as "2nd Ave", etc., 
	but turned out to be staircases.
    <br clear=right>
	<center><h3>Day 4 (Aug 14) - Juneau, Alaska</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_04.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	Another sunny day! Juneau is the capital of Alaska, athough at 30,000 residents it is much smaller than Anchorage (250,000 people).
	Our morning excursion included an overview of the town, a fish hatchery, a stop at a church by a beautiful lake, and a visit to the Mendenhall Glacier.
	The glacier is termed a "freshwater" glacier in that it terminates well short of the ocean and melts into a small lake.</p>
	<p>In the afternoon we walked around the part of the town closer to the cruise dock. There were a lot of souvenir and t-shirt shops there.
	The temperature reached the low 70's so was quite pleasant.
    <br clear=left>
	<center><h3>Day 5 (Aug 15) - Skagway, Alaska</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_05.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	And another sunny day! Skagway is a tiny town of about 800 permanent residents which swells to several thousand people 
	in the summer. It is basically a reconstructed frontier town, reminiscent of when it was the gateway to the
	Klondike goldrush. Our morning excursion included a trip around the town, a drive up to a lookout over the city, and 
	a musical theatre production about the life of <i>Soapy Smith</i>.</p>
	<p>In the afternoon, we wandered around the town and looked at the frontier buildings. There were 4 cruise ships
	in port that day, and the number of passengers kind of overwhelmed the town. It was very busy!
    <br clear=right>
	<center><h3>Day 6 (Aug 16) - Cruising Glacier Bay</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_06.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	Once again we were treated to a day of glorious sunshine. Glacier Bay is a national park that includes a number of
	huge saltwater glaciers. A hundred years ago or so, the bay was hidden by the glaciers, 
	but the glaciers have since receded opening up the bay to ships and cruisers. As we floated in front of the
	Margerie Glacier, huge chunks were "calving" into the ocean. There were no large icebergs in the water, though,
	as the chunks exploded into small fragments as they hit the water.<p>
	<p>During the day we explored  several channels within Glacier Bay and saw a number of large glacier flows. The
	wind off the glaciers was freezing. Despite being a sunny day, everyone was bundled up  in coats and blankets.
    <br clear=left>
	<center><h3>Day 7 (Aug 17) - Cruising College Fjord</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_07.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	After 5 days of sunny weather, it turned to cloud again. We had been told that the real blue colour of the glaciers 
	was most noticeable on a cloudy day. They were right. The glaciers of College Fjord were as amazing as those
	in Glacier Bay. Some of the glaciers  were composites of two or more flows, and the flows were divided by black 
	gravel (see picture).
	<p>We were a little too late in the season to see sea otter and seal pups. Apparently the numerous ice chunks 
	floating in the water confuse the killer whales' sonar, and so the seals and otters are quite safe in the bays.
    <br clear=right>
	<center><h3>Day 8 (Aug 18) - Seward and Anchorage</h3></center>
	<p><img src="images/diary_alaska_0801/photo_alaska_0801_08.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	Our final day started off cool and rainy. We docked at Seward, and disembarked. From there, we were bused to
	Anchorage, about a 3 hour drive. The sun came out during the trip and the scenery was quite spectacular. We drove 
	up a peninsula, so were sometimes near the water and other times in the mountains.</p>
	<p>Anchorage airport was very busy, as all of the freight planes doing the arctic great circle route stop there to refuel.
	From Anchorage, we flew to Seattle and then connected back to Calgary. What a wonderful trip!
