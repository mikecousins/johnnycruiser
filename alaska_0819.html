      <p>In all my life I never would have believed I would own a Rolls Royce, buy a luxury villa in Monte Carlo
	  or do a 10 day Crystal Cruise. However, Marjorie somehow found some T/A pricing that deflated the
	  booking price to that of a normal (peon) cruise. So, with one week notice we signed up for a 10 day
	  Alaska cruise on the Crystal Symphony. That meant we had to scramble to find shelter for our kitties,
	  flights to/from Vancouver and  Marjorie had to rearrange her part time work schedule. Fortunately
	  it all came together and we were soon booked to mix with the rich and famous.
	  <p>It was difficult to compare the Crystal cruise to the "mass market" cruises we have done so stuck
	  to recalling our travels on Oceania.  The ships are close in passenger capacity (Symphony @ 848, 
	  Nautica @ 684, Marina @ 1250). The major pluses for the Crystal Symphony were the wrap around promenade deck,
	  a 12 to 14 page daily guide "Reflections" (most interesting!), great lecturers, big ship style atrium, liquor is included,
	  wi-fi is included, and there was free Ben & Jerry's ice cream.  Also, there was a wonderful library with a good
	  selection of books and a full time librarian to keep things organized.
	  <p>Minuses were few but here's some. Our cabin window was on the promenade deck
	  so people walking the deck could peer into our cabin. The window was treated with a reflective coating which
	  worked fine during the day but not so good at night. There was still one formal night for the 10 day cruise which we 
	  just ignored and did a specialty restaurant instead. Trivia was almost non-existent. It was only offered on
	  sea days and then only once a day. It was always at 12:05 PM,  which was right at lunch time. Speaking of lunch
	  I really missed my daily surf and turf plate and chocolate milkshake. Finally, of no 
	  consequence to Marjorie or me, there was no buffet at dinner time. Instead the buffet area was converted each night
	  into a Brazillian BBQ (you know those steak on a sword places?).
	  <p>We had 757 ship mates so the ship was shy about 100 people. This probably added to the very uncrowded feeling
	  of the ship (high public space to passenger ratio) I don't remember a single line up.

       <h3>Day 1 (Aug 10) - Traveling to Vancouver and boarding</h3>
      </center>

      <img src="images/diary_alaska_0819/photo_alaska_0819_02.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      Yesterday we took all four kitties to the Cattery kennel. Today we drove 
      to Christina's about 7:00 Am and Matt drove us to the airport. We had a 
      10:00 flight to Vancouver. and landed there about 10:30. We caught the Canada 
      Line train and were downtown at the Pan Pacific cruise terminal by just 
      before noon. We went through a cruise security process and then boarded 
      the ship to check-in. Crystal has the same check-in process as Oceania and 
      uses one of the ship's lounges instead of being processed in the terminal 
      building. By fluke we were docked behind the Nieuw Amsterdam which got
	  bashed up at the end of our Pacific coast cruise in May this year.
	  We were fed lunch in the main dining room instead of the buffet 
      which was a nice touch. While waiting for our rooms to open at 3:00, Marjorie 
      headed off the ship for a preplanned meeting with Lynn and Jeanne. I stayed 
      on the ship and read my book. Our bags were in the cabin when 3:00 PM arrived, 
      so I unloaded all my stuff. Marjorie arrived soon after and unloaded her 
      stuff. Muster was at 5:15 sailing at 6:00.
	  For our first dinner, we went to Silk - a free specialty
	  restaurant specializing in Chinese cuisine. It was good. The entertainment
	  was the ship's singers and dancers, so we opted for an early night.

     We woke up to an overcast day for our first day at sea. It was warm and dry though. We were heading 
	 up the inside passage to reach Endicott Arm. It was a nice day at sea - exploring the ship, playing the
	 first of three trivias, trying out the restaurants, and enjoying the scenery. We did well at trivia teaming up 
	 with a British lady and her 13 year old son. We tied for the win and then lost the tie breaker. Our lecture 
	 series started, with three lectures - one doing the natural history of  Alaska, one telling myths and stories 
	 about Alaska and one doing corporate and political security (unrelated to Alaska!). Most did a presentation 
	 each sea day throughout the cruise. The next day was like a sea day as we never left the ship. 
	 It was a glacier-viewing day and lectures.  Also, we actually had a second round of trivia at noon, which
	 we once again tied for first. We won the tie breaker this time. After trivia, the captain  made a call (based on the weather and seas)
	 at whether we would sail up Endicott Arm or Tracy Arm. The decision was Endicott Arm. After visiting 
	 Glacier Bay (Margery Glacier), Yakatuk Bay (Hubbard Glacier) and College Fjord (various glaciers) on
	 previous cruises, Dawes Glacier wasn't nearly as impressive, We did the entertainment each night 
	 (comedian/musician and standup comic) which were both really good.

      From the advance weather report we weren't expecting the best weather in Haines. Were we wrong!
	  We woke up to a beautiful day. It was warm and sunny all day and I was fine in shorts and a t-shirt.
	  We had breakfast and then headed  out for the "HoHo" bus. Haines (pop. 1,700) is essentially two neighorhoods about half
	  a mile apart. One is an ex-military site (circa 1902) with the buildings converted into homes, condos, businesses and the other
	  is a newer business district with an IGA, restaurants, boutiques, etc. The bus took us around the military neighborhood 
	  and then drove over to the commercial neighbourhood.  The strangest building there was a hammer museum - yes, all you 
	  ever wanted to know about hammers! We decided to walk back to the ship along the waterfront. We grabbed some lunch 
	  and Marjorie decided to walk back and explore the commercial district. I was going to stay on the ship, but it was so nice 
	  out that I did a full circuit of the military area. It was about a mile hike but very pleasant. Back on the ship Marjorie
	  soon showed up and we decided to do the same hike I had just done for Marjorie's sake. Once again it was lovely
	  walking in the warm sun. We dined at the Uma Umi restaurant which featured Japanese food. We passed on the 
	  entertainment and did the wander the ship thing instead.

      Today was warm but overcast. This was our fifth time in Juneau, so we had seen it all (or almost all). However, they had
	  built a tramway (gondola) up the mountain a few years ago so we decided to try it. We had breakfast and 
	  then took the shuttle bus to the base of the tramway. When we went to purchase our tickets, we found out we didn't 
	  have enough money. How embarrasing! I stayed at the shuttle bus depot while Marjorie shuttled back to the ship
	  to get our credit card. So it was a slow start, but  at least we got to try the tramway. The ride up the mountain 
	  was only 5 minutes long, so you had to look quick. At the top there was a large building housing a souvenir shop, 
	  an art shop, a theatre and a restaurant. We did the theatre first where a native man played the hand drum (like a
	  tambourine without the bells) and narrated a slide show. Then we walked part of some trails for the scenic views. 
	  We spent some time in the shops, then headed back down the tramway and took the shuttle bus back to the ship.
	  Because it was overcast and we had seen Juneau before, we decided to stay on the ship for the afternoon.
	  We had dinner at Prego - the Italian restaurant. The entertainment was the song and dance crew so we decided 
	  to go to the movie theatre where we saw "Red Joan".  It was a decent movie.

      Today we were in Icy Strait Point (now known as Hoonah). This is a fairly new port of call and we visited here
	  last time while on the Millenium. It would be interesting to see what changes had been made. The weather was fine - 
	  overcast but mild. We did
	  breakfast and then headed out for a wander through the village. The first change is that there was a new
	  dock facility and we didn't have to tender in. There were some new buildings and a nature trail through the forest.
	  After watching a sextet of zip liners whiz through the air, we walked along the shore trying to remember what was here 
	  (or wasn't here) before. We popped back to the ship for lunch. In the afternoon we went back ashore to explore the
	  new section of the village. We walked down a beach covered with inukshuks and walked a trail through the forest.
	  Featured in the nature trail was an adventure park with swinging bridges and other inter-tree apparatus. Back on
	  the ship we read until dinner time. For the first time on the cruise we tried the main dining room. It was very good. 
	  The entertainer was a comedian and he was excellent. Instead of spouting a memorized routing, he instead interacted
	  with the crowd. He was very quick witted and had everyone in stitches. Time for bed.

        <h3>Day 7  (Aug 16) - Sea otters and Sitka</h3>

	   We arrived in Sitka to some heavy mists. We had been here once before on a beautiful sunny day,
	   so didn't mind the mist. Last time we had to tender in, but now, like Hoona, they had remedied this by
	   building a docking facility. Nice! We had booked a "Whale and Sea Otter" tour at 12:30 so
	   spent the morning wandering around the docking area (a ways from town). We normally book the
	   morning excursions but this one was full up except for the afternoon time (we were late booking). It worked
	   out well though as the morning group had fog and couldn't see anything while we had high clouds 
	   with perfect visibility. We were picked up by a large tour boat that was only 1/3 full. Lots of room 
	   with few people. During our trip to and from the large inlet we saw several humpback whales,
	   some Steller's sea lions, several "rafts" of sea otters and some bald eagles (in the trees).The 
	   sea otters form uni-sex groups holding hands while attached to a kelp bed. These groups, called 
	   rafts, can be sexed by the presence of pups. Youngsters would be in a female raft. The trip was
	   excellent and we felt we had seen everything we had looked forward to. The nightly entertainment 
	   was the ship's singers and dancers so we skipped it in turn for an early night.

	   Today we pulled into Ketchikan. It was a very gray day with heavy clouds. Like Juneau, Ketchikan had 
	   been on all of our previous Alaskan cruise itineraries, so this was also our fifth visit here. We had visited the tourist
	   spots outside of town (totem park, seaplane tour, etc)
	   and walked from end to end in the town on previous visits so just had a relaxing day with nothing 
	   planned.  The town was hopping as we shared the downtown area with several other cruise
	   ships. We both walked around the Creek Street area in the morning. There were some nice 
	   art shops, but we didn't buy anyting  (house is full). Marjorie did a shopping forray on her own
	   in the afternoon, looking for a photo or painting of a sea otter. No luck!
	   We had
	   dinner in the main dining room. The evening entertainment was Latin dancing which we avoided.
	   We wandered the ship for a while and then turned in early.

	  Leaving Ketchikan, we had a sea day  in the Inside Passage, then a day in Victoria. The sea day was
	  cool and cloudy, but that was OK. Marjorie did a galley tour and learned how all of our meals were 
	  prepared. The final lectures were given from our wonderful speakers. And, of course, we had our final trivia session. 
	  For the third time we tied for first and had to do a tie breaker (which we won). It was a nice relaxing day. The
	  following day we pulled into a sunny and warm Victoria. The first thing we had to do was the Canada Cutoms
	  thingy (on shore) as this was our first Canadian port. For the morning Marjorie and I packed a back pack 
	  and  took the ship's shuttle bus to the Empress Hotel, where we waited for the city bus to Butchart Gardens. It
	  was about a 1/2 hour wait and then a 1/2 hour bus ride. The gardens were beautiful. There were lots of people there, 
	  but the gardens didn't seem crowded. We spent almost 2 hours enjoying the flowers and then called D&J to pick 
	  us up (around 1:00 PM). They were soon there in their brand new car (very nice!!) and took us to a nearby restaurant on
	  the ocean front (Seahorses Cafe in Brentwood Bay). After lunch we went back to their house via Rogers Chocolates. Always have to stop there!
	  We had a nice visit and then they drove us back to the cruise dock in time for our dinner. It was a lovely day and 
	  we enjoyed our visit with D&J. The entertainment was "Liar's Club" which is very good but we none-the-less 
	  skipped in order to pack our clothes.

      We woke up today on a beautiful sunny day in Vancouver. We had a 1:30 flight home, so took our time. 
	  We were off the ship as late as we could (9:00 AM) and caught the Canada Line train to the airport. We were there
	  in plenty of time to get lunch at  (oops, I forget). Our flight was ontime and we were in Calgary by about 3:00 PM.
	  Christina was there to pick us up. We drove back to her place and then headed home. Once there we had to hustle out
	  to the kennel place to pick up our four kitties. They were glad to go home. Once again we have had a marvellous journey to Alaska.
