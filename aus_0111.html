      <p>Several years ago we had booked a 31 day cruise from Sydney to San Francisco on the Dawn Princess,
	  which was subsequently cancelled by Princess when they decided to move the Dawn into the Australian
	  market. As a result, we were given a future cruise credit of 50% off, to be used on a South Pacific cruise of at least
	  35 days. We finally settled on this cruise. With the discount, the price dropped to $72 per day per person. Amazingly
	  inexpensive! At the time we booked it, it  was marketed as a 35 day cruise. Later on 
	  we discovered that it was actually 2 back-to-back cruises of 12 and 23 days. To keep the diary a reasonable size, I will 
	  write up the 2 legs as 2 separate diaries.</p>
	  <p>The first leg of the cruise took us from Auckland to Sydney in 12 days. We did not know anyone on this leg before
	  the cruise, other than the folks we had met online through Cruise Critic. So, it was going to be an opportunity to meet lots of new people.
	  We had booked "anytime dining" and had a full slate of shore tours arranged.
	  The ship was essentially full at 2606 passengers, of which about 600 of us would be staying on for the second leg to Beijing.</p>
	  <p>As a special bonus, we were looking forward to visiting with folks in Auckland (Bob and Sheryl, dinnermates from our around 
	  Australia cruise last year) and folks in Dunedin (Peter and Halcyon, trivia-mates from our Black Sea cruise, also last year). 
	  Below I'll refer to our friends as B&S and P&H.</p>
	  <p><b>Note: </b>Because we were traveling for 6 weeks and visiting both summer and winter climates, we had to decide
	  what clothes to take. We opted to drop formal night clothes in deference to coats, toques and mitts for China. So, we
	  skipped all 6 formal nights in the dining room and instead ate in the buffet. That worked out just fine.

       <h3>Pre-cruise (Jan 23 - 25) - Travel to Auckland</h3>
      </center>

      <p>We had a mid-afternoon flight, so Chrissy and Matt picked us up at 11:30 AM. We drove 
	  to the White Spot near the airport where I had the roast beef. It was very good.
	  Then we drove on to the airport, arriving there at 1:00 PM. We checked in,
	  went through US customs pre-clearance and waited for 
	  our 3:55 flight to San Francisco. Our flight was ontime and we arrived in San Francisco at 
	  5:45 PM. We had a quick 2 hour layover and left 
	  again at 7:45. For some reason the flight to Auckland was only 11:40 hours long rather than 
	  13:00 hours as scheduled. I wasn't sure why. Jan 24 disappeared 
	  as we flew over the dateline. We arrived in NZ at 4:45 AM. As usual, we did not sleep at all
	  on the airplane. Going through the NZ customs, grabbing our
	  baggage and then locating the Super 
	  Shuttle to the Langham took about an hour. We checked in to the Langham at 6:00 AM. We  
	  were prepared for an early arrival and had booked the night before so that we would have a 
	  room to crash in. We were in bed by 6:30 to catch the end of the night (it was still dark out).

      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_04.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>We woke up at  9:30 AM or so feeling slightly refreshed. We had been to Auckland 3 years
	  ago and had done the HO-HO bus around the city, visiting all the highlights. 
	  This time we had no plans for any sightseeing in the big city.
	  We headed out on the LANGHAM shuttle to downtown. It was only a few blocks, but the shuttle
	  made it easy. We walked around the downtown area, bought some 
	  groceries (bullets, drinks, wine, cookies) and had lunch at a cafe with great fish & chips. We
	  walked 
	  around some more, bought some souvenirs, and then shuttled back to Langham at 1:45. 
	  It was a warm and sunny day, so we went out to the pool - me to swim and Marj to read. 
	  I met a young honeymoon couple in the pool who 
	  were from Edmonton. Small world!  The pool attendant brought around free nibblies - 
	  olives and bread sticks wrapped in prosciutto. Afterwards we did a quick walk around the 
	  neighbourhood to locate a place for breakfast. The hotel charged $37 (each!) for breakfast, 
	  but we found a fast food place that did the same for $5. 
	  We didn't do dinner, but just read and watched tennis on TV. We were in bed by 9:00 PM. 
	  We slept pretty well.</p>
<p>The next day we were up at 6:00 AM, then off to breakfast at 7:00. The little restaurant we 
had found yesterday did a really good breakfast. I had a hot chocolate with my meal and it 
came whipped, with a pattern in the foam. Afterwards we hiked down the block to 
Starbucks where Marj had a hot chocolate. Then it was back to the hotel to shower, pack and 
checkout. B&S were picking us up at 9:30.

      <p>B&S met us in the lobby just after 9:00 AM. It was another beautiful sunny day, around 25 
	  degrees. We drove about an hour north to the village of Leigh, stopping at their home. 
	  B&S toured us around their yard (lots of flowers and veggies)
	  and house. Lovely! We had a cup of tea and visited for a while, then headed to the nearby 
	  Ascension Winery for lunch. I had delicious lamb kabobs! 
	  We drove back to house and then walked around the local harbour. B&S are very fortunate to
	  be so close to the water. Bob did a barbie for dinner - beef and 
	  chicken. Excellent! We visited for the evening, but were early to bed - still recovering from the time difference. </p>
<p>We woke up at 6:30 AM, so got up, checked our email and read a bit. B&S were up shortly after for
breakfast. Aftwerwards we drove north to Cape Rodney - Okakari Point marine reserve (Goat Island) and walked 
along the beach. Once again it was a beautiful sunny day. There were lots of shag on the beach, a bird
not seen in North America. The water was quite churned up, so we couldn't see much in the way of fish,
just a few large snapper.
We returned to the house for lunch. After lunch, we headed back into 
Auckland. We were at the ship by about 1:30. We said goodbye to B&S and entered the cruise terminal. 
What a wonderful time we had in Leigh! Thank you Bob and Sheryl.

      <p>After saying goodbye to B&S, we entered the cruise terminal building. We had to go through 
	  several lineups - local security, NZ passport control and dog sniffing, then the Princess check-in desk.
	  However, it was fairly quiet so the lines moved quite quickly. We were on board by 2:30 PM, so our 
	  cabin was ready for us.  The first thing I did was to phone room service to trade our free bar setup
	  for 20 cans of Coke. (I get free Coke because we are Elite). The bar girl showed up almost immediately
	  and I stocked the fridge. Our luggage arrived shortly after, so we unpacked and put things away.
	  We wandered the ship, reaquainting ourselves with the Diamond Princess (yes, we cruised her in 
	  2004 when she was only 6 weeks old). The Diamond was in dry dock for refurbishment just 2 
	  months ago, so she was in fine shape. Muster drill was at 5:15 PM. We headed down to dinner about 
	  6:00 PM. There are four smallish dining rooms for the anytime diners. Each restaurant has its one 
	  "specialty" plus, of course, the regular dinner menu. I had prime rib which was very good. 
	  We skipped the entertainment and instead went early to bed.

        <h3>Day 2 (Jan 28) - Counting Sheep in Tauranga</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_12.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_13.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>Today we arrived in Tauranga at 9:00 AM. The forecast was for cloud, 
        24 degrees and it was supposed to rain in the later afternoon. We were 
        up at 7:00 and had breakfast. We met for our all day tour at 9:20 in the 
        theatre. We drove through the village of Tauranga and then out into the countryside 
        towards Rotarua. Our first stop was at the Agrodome (I know it's spelled 
        wrong, but that's how they spell it). We wandered around the hobby farm 
        and then went into the "dome" for the sheep show. On stage there looked 
        to be a bunch of plastic sheep, but when we approached, they were real! 
        As part of the show, they paraded out examples of all 19 varieties of 
        NZ sheep and talked about their characteristics. Then there was a sheep 
        shearing demo followed by 3 sheep dogs herding a flock of geese around 
        the stage. Finally a large milk cow was brought out and 3 of the audience 
        got to milk it. Lots of fun! Then we went outside to a demo of the sheep dogs
		with a real flock of sheep. After the show we browsed through the gift shop.</p> 
        <p>Then we drove into Rotarua to a hotel for lunch. We attacked the wonderful 
        buffet at about 2:00 PM. As we ate, there was a Maori entertainment show 
        on stage. It was very good. Then we were off to <a href="http://www.tepuia.com/">Te 
        Puia</a> to see the geysers and bubbling mud pits. The site was owned 
        and run by Maori people so there was stuff about the Maori culture. The 
        gift shop had a wonderful variety of all things Maori. If only we had 
        more room at home! We left the thermal attraction at 5:00. The town of 
        Rotarua has a beautiful public garden, so the bus took us on a drive-through. 
        Then we drove back to Tauranga (about 1.5 hours). As we travelled through
		the countryside, it started to rain. That was OK though as we were on the bus.
		Back aboard we made 
        it to dinner about 7:00, so didn't get out of the restaurant until 9:00. 
        I had the shrimp kabobs. Yummy! We skipped the entertainment as it was 
        too late.

        <h3>Days 3,4 (Jan 29,30) - Day at sea, then Christchurch</h3>

      <p><b>Day 3</b> - Today was a day at sea. A cyclone was supposed to be hitting the area. 
	  The day was cool, windy 
	  and rainy. I was up at 6:30 and off to gym just after 7. It was packed so I left. 
	  We went to breakfast and then trivia at 9:30. At our first trivia, we met a couple who were to 
	  become faithful trivia mates (right through to Beijing) - Ray and Mary Jane. There was a
	  lecture at 11:00. We had lunch in the Savoy restaurant - it was a British pub lunch with fish and chips.
	  At 1:30 we did the spa draws, but didn't win anything. Then Marj headed off to another
	  lecture, while I took another stab at the gym (not so busy this time). I realized after 
	  that we had missed the Cruise Critic get together at 1:30. Oh well, we would meet some of the 
	  folks out and about. I watched 
	  some Corner Gas, then went to trivia at 4:30. It was dressup night so we did buffet instead. 
	  Afterwards we went to singer in the Explorers Lounge. 
	  He was OK, but did Frank S, Tony B, Andy W, Ray C, etc. which aren't really my cup of tea.

<p><b>Day 4</b> - The ship rocked and rolled all night. Today though was 
supposed to be sunny and 24. Instead, we had heavy cloud, some rain and it was cool.
We had an all day tour booked for Christchurch, travelling on the Tranz Alpine Railway (I know it's
spelled wrong, but that's how they spell it). We were up at 
6:30, off to breakfast, and then met for the tour at 7:50. There were 5 bus loads of us for this tour. 
We headed out to the bus and drove 2 minutes to theTranz Alpine 
train parked in sight of the ship. Why didn't we just walk? Normally the train travels from 
Christchurch ( on the east coast) to Greymouth (on the west coast) across the Southern Alps.
However, due to our time constraints, the ship had arranged for us to go about halfway - to
Arthur's Pass. After that, we were to be bused to a sheep farm.
The trip to Arthur's Pass took about 2.5 hours and travelled through fields and valleys and 
mountains. Along the way we were served drinks, and then lunch. 
We had a stop at Springfield along way, to stretch our legs. 
The stop at A.P. lasted for 30 min then we got the news that our bus (bus #3) had broken down. 
It was raining and cool by now. Our group (bus #3) were
put back on train while the others left by bus. At Springfield, we were greeted
by the replacement bus. We drive to 
Deans Farm and caught up with the other buses. It was still cloudy but warming up.  We were served
cookies and tea, and then given sheep shearing and 
sheep dog demos. I was starting to think that I could shear a sheep myself now.
Then we drove to Christchurch for tour through the city. There were visible signs of the 
September earthquake damage - repair scaffolding, cracked brickwork, etc. We were back to ship 
by 5:30. We changed for dinner and headed down to the dining room. I had lamb roast. 
We skipped the entertainment.</p>
<p><b>Postscript:</b> As we surveyed the minor earthquake damage in Christchurch, we had no idea
that two weeks later Christchurch would be hit by a devastating earthquake destroying parts of the city
and the beautiful cathedral.

        <h3>Day 5 (Jan 31) - Visiting in Dunedin</h3>
      </center>

      <p>Today we were in Dunedin (Port Chalmers is the port). We were going to spend the day with some
	  friends that we met on our Black Sea cruise last June. Peter was working, but we would see him
	  later in the day, so Halcyon chaperoned us for most of the day. We had breakfast and then headed off the ship
	  about 8:45 AM. Halcyon was already waiting for us as we exited the cruise terminal. She drove us
	  from Port Chalmers to Dunedin going a "back route" where we could see the beautiful countryside.
	  We stopped at a high outlook that  gave us a wonderful view of the surrounding hills and valleys.
	  Then we drove through Dunedin seeing the residential and commercial areas, and the "steepest 
	  street in the world". Then we stopped at the botanical gardens and had a lovely walk through the flower
	  gardens. This was extra special as it was winter back home! After touring the gardens, we drove 
	  to very near the place where Peter worked and met him and two of their daughters (Antonia and
	  Annushka) at a restaurant for lunch. In the afternoon we left Peter and the daughters, and 
	  Halcyon took us to see <a href="http://www.olveston.co.nz/">Olveston House</a>.
	  This was a large, stately manor built around 1900 for the Theomin family. It was furnished with period furniture
	  and was very interesting.

      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_24.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>Afterwards we drove to the Otago Museum where Antonia and Annushka
	  met us again. This museum was full of Maori
	  artefacts, but we unfortunately didn't have nearly enough time to do it justice. This will be a must 
	  visit if we return to Dunedin again. While at the museum, the skies clouded over and it poured in rain.
	  After the museum, we walked next door to the Otago University and the daughters showed
	  us around the campus (both had attended school there). It was sunny again and the campus
	  buildings stood out in the blue sky and sunshine. It was nearing 4:00 PM by now, so Halcyon drove us all 
	  back to Peter's workplace. Along the way we picked up a third daughter (Felicity). We arrived 
	  about 20 minutes or so before Peter finished work. We said goodbye to Halcyon and the family,
	  then Marj and I wandered over to the famous train station to take some photos.
      Peter finished for the day and drove us back to the ship by 5:15. It had been a wonderful
	  day with our Dunedin friends. Thank you Halcyon and Peter!
	  We changed and went straight to dinner - I had braised short ribs. We skipped the entertainment.</p>
	  <p><b>Note:</b> On a recent summer vacation, Annushka and Felicity rode their bicycles across Canada 
	  - from Victoria to St. John's. That is an awesome feat and something to be proud of! Well done.

        <h3>Days 6-8 (Feb 1-3) - Milford Sound and Crossing the Tasman Sea</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_28.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="310"> 
      <p><b>Day 6</b> - Today we were scheduled to sail around the bottom of 
	  New Z ealand
        and then into DuskySound and Milford Sound (fjords). Due to some winds and 
        bumpy seas (we tossed and turned all night), we arrived at the fjords quite 
		late (noon and 6:00 PM respectively). 
		To add insult to injury, there was a heavy mist that  prevented seeing the full
		glory of the majestic mountains rising from the sea - one could only see the lower part
		of the coastline. Marjorie and I had done these fjords several years ago, and it had 
		been in blue sky and sunshine. So, this time we did not bother going outside into the cold
		or taking any photos. Instead, we treated this day and the next two as three sea days 
		in a row. We did feel sorry though for those other cruisers who had not been
		here before.</p>
		<p><b>Days 7 & 8</b> - These were typical sea days - breakfast, trivia, gym, Corner Gas,
		lecture, lunch, play some cards, trivia, dinner, entertainment, off to bed.
       Our first day on the Tasman was calm and sunny, the second day was cloudy 
	   and a bit rough. One afternoon was a Cruise critic tea, so we got to meet a few 
	   people that we had missed on the first get together. Dinners for
	   the three sea days were shrimp 
	   kebobs, pot roast and roast lamb - all very good. We attended a group called 
	   Encore (soprano, tenor and baritone) who did a wonderful program of opera,
	   showtunes and popular songs. The following night they were in Explorers
	   Lounge for another concert. Unfortunately they did exactly the same program
	   again, but it was still excellent. We gained a bit of time too, as twice we had
	   to put our clocks back 1 hour.

        <h3>Day 9 (Feb 4) - Back to Hobart</h3>
      </center>

      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_30.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>We arrived at Hobart around 7:00 AM. It was sunny and blue sky, about 24 degrees.
	  We grabbed breakfast, and then headed off to our tour at 8:30. We drove south
	  on the bus to the quaint village of Richmond, arriving by 10:00 AM. Our first 
	  stop there was at the church of St. John. Then we drove down the main street and stopped
	  at the Richmond Gaol, built in 1825. After touring through the old gaol, we were given time to wander
	  around the town. We chose to walk along the river to the old Richmond Bridge.  What
	  a gorgeous day! The bridge was built  in 1823 to 1825 and is the oldest bridge in 
	  Australia still in operation. We walked around about 1 hour enjoying the sunshine and 
	  the period buildings. We looked through some shops near the gaol and then 
	  reboarded the bus.

		<img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_32.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
        <p>We drove through the countryside to an animal park called Bonorong, arriving at 11:45. 
		We were given an hour to wander through the park. Grey kangaroos wandered freely with the 
		people, but the other animals were fenced off. We saw wombats, koalas, quolls, emus,  
        Tasmanian devils, various birds, etc. It was a wonderful park and I really enjoyed petting 
		and feeding the kangaroos. They are so laid back and gentle. We hopped back on the
		bus and were back to the ship by 1:15. We had a late lunch and headed back out again. 
		We caught the 2:00 PM Hobart city center shuttle and wandered around the downtown area.
		We had been here before, so knew our way around (somewhat). We popped into a liquor store
		and I bought a few Cascade beer (local brew).  On our walk back to the shuttle we stopped
		at the main town square. There were some interesting civic buildings surrounding the square, 
		and a statue / fountain in the middle.
		We were back on the ship just in time for the Hobart Police Pipe Band.
		Marj went to see them (er, hear them?) in the theatre, while I went to the gym. We heard the 
		same pipe band a year ago when we did the around Oz cruise, so once was enough.
        For dinner I had leg of lamb. We skipped the entertainment.

      <p><b>Day 10</b> - Today was a day at sea as we headed across the Bass Straight. 
	  It was cool and cloudy, with occasional rain. Perfect for a day at sea! 
        It was a typical sea day - breakfast, trivia, gym, Corner Gas, lecture. For lunch they
		did my favorite English Pub lunch with wonderful fish & chips. Then it was
		another lecture and trivia. It was formal night so we had dinner in the buffet. We 
		struck up a conversation with some folks from NZ and ended up sitting with them.
        We skipped the entertainment.</p>
      <p><b>Day 11</b> - We arrived in Melbourne at 7:00 AM. It had reached 40 
        degress the previous week in honour of the Australian Open (tennis), Today 
        was mixed sun and cloud and only 9 or 10 degrees. Brrrr! The previous 
        couple of days had seen heavy rain thanks to Cyclone Yasi, 
		and lots of areas in and around Melbourne 
        were flooded. We had breakfast and then met for a ship's tour at 8:00. 
        It was currently sunny. We did a driving tour of the city, but it was 
        interrupted by some flooded streets. At one point we were going the wrong 
        way down a one way street. Our guide said "<i>Don't worry. This is a one 
        way street and we're only going one way</i>".</p>
      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_41.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_aus_0111/photo_aus_0111_42.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
<p>Then we drove out into the outskirts of Melbourne 
to Fern Gully and boarded Puffing Billy - an old steam train. 
By this time it was raining and cold! We did a shortened 
trip, stopping as the track was cleared of storm debris from the previous days. We were on
the train about an hour, disembarking at Melrose. Then we returned to the bus and drove through 
flooded fields to the Warrook Homestead cattle ranch. There we had a sheep dog demo and a sheep shearing 
show. All they seem to do in Oz is shear sheep! We had a wonderful beef and chicken lunch about
1:30. Just before 
boarding the bus I sidetracked to a wombat pen where an older guy let me pet the (huge) wombat and feed him 
a carrot. The trip back to the ship, normally 1 hour, took 2.5 hours due to the main highway being closed in 
places and having to detour on slower roads. We were back to the ship at dinner time. Tonight was
rack of lamb. It was good. No entertainment for us tonight.

        <h3>Days 12,13 (Jan 28) - At sea, then Sydney</h3>

      <p><b>Day 12</b> - Today was our final day at sea for this leg - breakfast, trivia, gym/lectures, 
        Corner Gas. Nothing exciting, can't remember dinner. In the evening there 
        were lots of suitcases in the hallways as only 600 of us (out of 2,600) 
        were staying on. It felt good not having to pack our bags!</p>
	  <p><b>Day 13</b> - Today was turnaround day in Sydney. We arrived 6:00 AM. It was
	  still dark as we sailed into the harbour and the city was lit up for us.
	  The opera house and harbour bridge twinkled in the dawn. We had breakfast, 
        and met for our ship's tour at 9:00. It was a 2 hour harbour cruise with Captain Cook
		Cruises. We walked about 5 minutes to the Captain Cook pier. Had we known, we could have just
		bought our tour tickets from CCC for half the cost of the ship's tour! Oh well. It was cloudy
		(but warm) for the cruise which made our photos really dull, but the cruise itself was very interesting.
		It is a huge harbour and we circumnavigated all sides. The guide pointed out some huge homes
		along the shore that started at $20 million. A bit too much for us!
		We were back by noon. We walked around the downtown area looking for souvenirs
		and bought some aboriginal art drink coasters for our Calgary neighbour who was 
		cleaning our driveway. We headed back to the ship for a late lunch and joined the
		new crowd of passengers boarding the ship for the Beijing leg.</p>
