    <p>When we were looking at back-to-back river cruises, we  ended up with a 7 day
	gap between the cruises. Hence, we put together a week long land tour to fill in the
	week. We wanted to see around Provence and decided that staying on in
	Avignon was the best way to do that. We also had never been to Belgium
	or Luxembourg and discovered that Brussels was central to that whole area.
	So that meant booking hotels in Avignon and Brussels, booking day tours to see the 
	area and booking trains and planes to transfer between locations. A lot of work 
	compared to booking a cruise! </p>
	<p>Anyway, Marjorie pulled it all together and things
	went quite smoothly. The only difficult task was finding a decent hotel in Avignon.
	It turned out that we were there during the annual arts festival - the largest festival in
	France! This meant there was very little in the way of available rooms and prices
	were at least doubled. Hence this was the most expensive of all of our hotels, and 
	also the crappiest by a mile.</p>
    <p>This diary documents just the week between the cruises. See the separate 
	diaries for the preceding cruise
	<a href="france_0715.html"> Lyon through Avignon</a>,
	and the following cruise
	<a href="rhine_0715.html"> 
    Prague through Luxembourg</a>.</p>

    We left off  the previous cruise diary with us getting off the ship and catching
	a taxi. The taxi brought us to the Adagio Hotel. We had picked it because is was
	very close to the TGV (high speed train) station. However, we were miles out of Avignon
	and there wasn't much around other than commercial and light industrial buildings.
	Not a good location for scenic walks! The hotel itself was more like a hostel. The
	front desk was only open a couple of hours in the morning and then another
	couple of hours later in the afternoon. If you needed someone outside of these 
	hours you were out of luck. We checked in to our tiny room and immediately decided 
	it was time for a walk to familiarize ourselves with the area. First of all we walked to
	the TGV station to check it out. We found out where we had to go  when we did our
	TGV train trip to Brussels in a couple of days. We heard there was a Carrefour
	Grocery store also nearby, but it was Sunday again, so everything was closed.
	We passed a MacDonalds so decided to have lunch there. We returned to the 
	hotel by about 1:30. We had booked a Viator tour for the afternoon and they were
	picking us up at 2:00 PM.

     The minivan showed up just after 2:00. There would be 8 of us. A nice size for a tour.
	 We drove through Avignon to pick up the other folks and then headed north to Orange.
	 Just as we entered the town we stopped at a Roman triumphal arch. It was built
	  during the reign of Augustus (27 BC - AD 14). Then we headed into the old town for a walking tour.
	  We ended up at the Roman amphitheatre where our guide purchased tickets for 
	  the theatre and a museum. Then we were given two hours or so to meander
	  through the theatre and the museum. We did the theatre first.
	  The Theatre Antique d'Orange ("Ancient Theatre of Orange") is an ancient Roman theatre in 
	  Orange, France, built early in the 1st century AD. It is owned by the municipality of Orange 
	  and is the home of the summer opera festival, the Choregies d'Orange. We had audio boxes 
	  that explained all of the points of interest. The Theatre d'Orange is one of a few Roman theatres 
	  which still retains the Scaenae frons, its rear wall. Afterwards we crossed the street to the historical 
	  museum and wandered through the displays. Once again we were given audio voxes to
	  listen to the description of the museum items. It was really hot out, so we spent the last of 
	  our free time at a nearby gelato shop.

    We walked to the minivan, climbed aboard and headed off for Chateauneuf-du-Pape. 
    Its confusing in that there are two Chateauneuf-du-Papes - one is a small 
    village and the other is an appellation (or wine growing region). We were aiming 
    for the appellation. As we drove through miles of vinyards, we stopped to get out 
	to see the grape bushes up close. The  soil was non-existent - it was just rocks!
	The bushes seemed to be thriving though, with lots of grapes. We finally stopped
	at a winery, the name of which I failed to write down. There we had a tasting of
	several red wines of the area. They had an interesting wine store with lots of 
	lavender products as well as wine stuff. Then it was time to take us back to 
	Avignon. We were back at our hotel by 6:45. We had noticed a pizza restaurant 
	at a neighbouring hotel so decided to give it a try. It was very good. We wandered
	around a bit then went to bed. The air conditioning was ineffective and we enjoyed
	a hot night.

     We were up at 7:00 and tried the hotel breakfast - bread, yoghurt and cereal. It was fine. It
	 was going to be another 35 degree day. We had booked an all day Viator tour that hit
	 five famous places in Provence - Pont du Gard, Les Baux, Roussillon,
	 Gordes and the Coustellet lavender museum. Once
	 again we were in a minivan with 6 other tourists. A nice group size! We were picked up 
	 at our hotel about 9:00 and headed into town to pick up the others. Then we drove west
	 to the site of the famous Roman Pont du Gard aqueduct and bridge.The bridge,
	 built in the first century AD, is part 
	 of the Nimes aqueduct, a 50 km-long (31 mi) structure built by the Romans to carry water 
	 from a spring at Uzes to the Roman colony of Nemausus (Nimes). At the site, we were 
	 given tickets to enter the park and about an hour to walk around. The arched aqueduct
	 was immense. Pictures just don't do it justice. We walked across the bridge to the other 
	 side for a different perspective. There was an olive tree there that was supposedly planted
	 in 908 AD, making it 1107 years old. We walked slowly back across the bridge and
	 along the path to the parking lot, checking
	 out some dry caves along the way. A very interesting site!

     We reboarded the bus and drove south east to Les Baux-de-Provence. Along
	 the way we passed vinyard after vinyard. This small tourist
	 village (pop. 450) is set on a hilltop in the midst of a small national park. We parked 
	 just outside the town and walked up a hill and into the walled village. At the entrance 
	 to the village there was a lookout over the rocky hillsides of bauxite, which was the
	 original reason for the growth of the village. We were given 
	 an hour or so to wander around the village on our own. Early on our walk we 
	 chanced upon a small outdoor restaurant, so we had lunch. I had a "salade Gallios"
	 and a local beer. Delightful! We continued around the narrow streets lined
	 with ceramic shops, restaurants and other tourist shops.  Our time was soon up and 
	 we headed back to Avignon. Soon after leaving Les Baux, we stopped at a Roman 
	 town (Glanum) for a photo of a mausoleum and triumphal arch.

	  We were back in Avignon about 2:00 to drop off a couple of morning "half dayers" and pick up a 
	  couple more for the afternoon. Our first destination for the afternoon was the lavender museum
	  in Coustellet, but when we got there the parking was full of cars and buses. It was packed. So, our guide
	  decided that we would return after the rest of our tour and it might not be so busy. Instead
	  we made for the hilltop village of
	  Roussillon. What makes Roussillon unique among hilltop villages is the surrounding ochre cliffs.
	  The ochre comes in reds, yellows and browns, and the buildings are stuccoed with ochre coloured
	  dirt. This gives a reddish tint to the village (from a distance). Some of the streets were really steep, 
	  but we toughed it out in the heat and made it to the highest point of the village where there were 
	  excellent views of the surrounding countryside. Our free time was ending so we headed back 
	  down to the village entrance to wait for the minivan. There was a grocery store right near the 
	  pickup point, so we bought some drinks and a local beer. Then it was onto the minivan and off
	  to our next destination. It was about 3:30.

	  Our next destination was another mountaintop village - Gordes. In contrast to Roussillon, there 
	  is no ochre around, so the colour scheme was grey limestone. As we approached the village 
	  we stopped at a viewpoint that offered a great view of the village. We stopped for some photos.
	  Once again we were dropped off at the entrance to the village and given about an hour to 
	  wander around. The streets were extremely steep and were a challenge to go up!  We did 
	  a few of the steep slopes but tried to stick to the encircling streets that were relatively flat.
	  It was still very hot out, so the shaded streets were really pleasant.
	  There was an interesting castle (Le Chateau de Gordes) but we didn't go inside. When
	  our time was up, we headed back to the parking lot where the van had let us out. It was
	  about 5:00 PM.

	  Our final destination was the lavender museum in Coustellet. Along the way we passed 
	  lots of lavender fields, but there was no colour because the lavender had all been 
	  harvested. It is usually harvested in mid-July, but this year was so hot so early that the 
	  lavender was harvested a couple of weeks earlier. We arrived 
	  in Coustellet about 5:30 and
	  had an hour to tour through the museum (with a Vox box) and then browse the gift shop. 
	  Marjorie bought some lavender soap. Then it was 6:30 and time to drive back to Avignon.
	  We asked to be dropped off at the Carrefour near our hotel. It was still open at 7:00
	  so we bought some snacks for tomorrow's breakfast. Walking back we stopped at 
	  MacDonald's for a quick bite. It was 7:30 by now. Then it was home for some reading
	  and then to bed. It had been a long day and we had covered many miles, but the
	  sights were really awesome. Great day!

     We were up at 6:00 AM to another 35 degree day.  BUT, we were off to Brussels today
	 where the weather for the past week had been in the low 20's. About 12 degrees cooler
	 than southern France. We packed our bags, ate our grocery store snacks and then checked
	 out of our lovely hotel. Wouldn't miss this place! We hauled our suitcases behind us as we 
	 walked over to the TGV station (about 1/2 mile). Our TGV train was at 9:49. The train was 
	 full as was the luggage area, so we had to place our luggage in the aisle next to our seats. 
	 Awkward! Our first stop was in Lyon (where we had begun our adventure). Lots of people 
	 got off the train so I was able to move our luggage to less obtrusive storage. The train cars 
	 had no route maps or location displays, and the top announcements were in French, so we 
	 had no idea where we were. I had to ask other passengers if we were at Brussels Midi yet.
	 Additional stops were at Vallee, Charles de Gaul Airport, Lille and finally Brussels Midi.

	 <p>We arrived at Brussels Midi station
	 about 4:00 PM. We had to ask directions to get tickets for our next leg 
	 and to find the tram we needed. There were no escalators to get down to the tram level, so 
	 had to navigate down two flights of stairs with our luggage. Not fun! However, we made it in one piece.
	 From Midi, we took the tram to Debrouke Place and
	 our hotel (the Metropole) was right next door. How convenient! 
	 The hotel was gorgeous. We checked in,
	 unpacked our clothes and then went on an orientation walk to familiarize
	 ourselves with our surroundings. We were very close to the tourist area, 
	 including the Grand Place, a huge town square lined with amazing 
	 heritage buildings. There was a nearby street rimmed with restaurants so we randomly 
	 picked Leons. I had rack of lamb which was delicious. Back on our feet, it
	 was so nice to be walking in a cool temperature. We located Brussels City 
	 Tours (BCT) where we would be originating tours from for the next 3 days. Then it 
	 was back to the hotel to read and veg prior to another busy day.
	 
    <p> <i><b>Note:</b> According to a city map, our hotel was at least a 20 to 
      30 minute walk from Brussels City Tours (BCT) which was on </i>Gras Markt<i> 
      street. I wrote to BCT and they said it was only 5 minutes to walk it. It 
      turned out to be about 7 minutes. The problem was that all of Brussels streets 
      are named in both French and Dutch. On the map both street names are printed, 
      but in the case of a long street, a long ways apart. I didn't realize that 
      </i>Gras Markt<i> (herb market street, a long way from the hotel) was the 
      same street as </i>Rue du Marche aux Herbs<i> (herb market street, close 
      to the hotel). Lesson learned.</i>

     We were up at 7:00 after a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed and a
	 nice cool temperature. The forecast was for 23 degrees in Brussels.  We had
	 two tours booked for today - a morning tour of Brussels and an afternoon tour of 
	 Antwerp. We had breakfast at Paul's Bakery where I had a tasty omelet. We 
	 met at the BCT office. There were lots of people there. These tours would 
	 not be like the small 8 person tours we had in Avignon, but rather 40 people
	 in a full size bus. The other difference we would find is that in Avignon these were
	 English speaking tours and the guides spoke only in English. The BCT tours
	 repeated everything in English, French, Dutch and Spanish. It was quite 
	 annoying. Anyway, our tour started with a walking tour of the Grand Place 
	 and the rest of the "old town". The buildings were very ornate, probably the
	 most ornate town square we have seen. The buildings we saw were La
	 Maison des Ducs de Brabant (a group of 6 guild houses), the Maison du Roi (used
	 to host guests of the monarchy), the Hotel De Ville (the town hall) and the group of
	 buildings including Le Pigeon (home of Victor Hugo). Another famous block of 
	 buildings was under restoration and covered by a huge cloth, so we didn't see it.
	 We ended up at the BCT office and walked up the hill to our bus.

    From here we drove to sights in the outskirts of Brussels. We drove past the 
    palace / residence of the current monarch of Belgium. Then we stopped at the 
    "Atomium" for some photos. It was built for the 1958 World's Fair, but is 
    now a science museum. The "atoms" each house museum rooms, restaurants, 
	etc, while the "bonds" house interconecting escalators. We thought of coming 
	back on the Ho-Ho another day to see through the museum, but we never did.
	The "mini-Europe" park was also nearby, but likewise we never did visit it.
	Next we stopped at the Basilique Nationale du Sacre 
    Coeur (a church). We wandered through the beautiful church and then took an 
    elevator (2 actually)
	to a walkway around the main dome. The view from the top was amazing. 
    Then we drove through the European Union business area with all the famous 
    EU HQ buildings. Finally we were back to the starting place where we disembarked 
    from our bus at 12:45. Our afternoon tour started at 1:00, so we ran across 
    the street to Wings for a sandwich and Coke. We were back to the bus stop 
    in time for the next tour. We were off to Antwerp.

    It was about an hour drive to Antwerp. When we got there the weather had changed 
    - it was overcast. Not great for photos. We started our walking tour and our 
    first stop was at a diamond shop. We had a tour of the facility and then a 
    lecture on cutting diamonds. It was essentially the same talk we had in Amsterdam 
    several cruises ago. The interesting fact was that more diamonds flowed through 
	Antwerp than through Amsterdam (or so we were told). We were there quite 
	a while because someone in our group 
    wanted to buy something, hence we stood around for a while. Finally we set 
    off to the harbour museum building. It was a modern design and we took escalators 
    up to the 8th floor which was an observation deck. Great views of the city! 
	The museum was housed in the core of the building (7 stories) while the 
	escalators wrapped around the outside walls. We didn't have time to do any of the museum.
    Then we walked through the main city square with the city hall and other interesting 
    buildings. We walked along the river front and then back to the bus. By the 
    time we were back in Brussels it was 7:00 PM. We walked to the <i>Ricotta 
    & Parmesan</i> for pizza. We were back to our hotel by 8:30, read for a bit then 
	had an early night.

    We were up at 7:00, ready for our next Viator tour. Today we would be going to Ghent and
	Bruges. On our way over to the BCT office we stopped for breakfast at Panos. We got
	to the bus by 9:00  and headed off on our 1 hour journey to Ghent. It was a partially 
	clouded day with a high of 22 degrees. At Ghent we were toured through the old town 
	area and then given some time on our own to wander around. The city was riddled with 
	canals, and the buildings lining the canals were very interesting. The only drawback
	was that a huge beer festival was taking place and beer tents and band stands were
	in every public square, so it was hard to take photos of the buildings and sculptures
	because of the tents. One interesting street used to be a medieval corn market. It is now
	lined with shops and restaurants. More exciting than corn!

    When our free time was up, we climbed aboard the bus and headed off to 
    Bruges about another hour away. At this point we were almost to the western 
    edge of Belgium. Whereas we had had some sun in Ghent, Bruges was straight 
    overcast and grey. Once again we were let off at the entrance to the old town. 
    As we walked through the 19th century area, it felt kind of artificial, like 
    an open air museum. We were given some free time 
    for lunch as it was about 2:00 by now. We tried Vivaldi's Restaurant and I 
    had a very good schnitzel. Afterwards we walked to the canal area and the 
    architecture was back to the same style as in Amsterdam and Ghent. We did 
    some more guided walking and ended up at a canal boat loading zone. We piled 
    ito the boat and had about an hour tour sailing up and down the canals. What 
    a wonderful view of the buildings. Then it was back to the bus for our 2 hour 
    ride back to Brussels. When we arrived back in Brussels, we got the driver 
    to drop us off at the Carrefour store so we could buy some breakfast snacks 
    and drinks. It was about 20 minutes to walk to our hotel and we arrived there 
    at 7:30. Phew, a long day! We had left over pizza for dinner, read for a while

    Today would be the last of our Viator tours. That suited us fine as we had 
    been touring continuously for 12 days! We woke up at 7:00 to a 22 degree day. 
    Once again we had to walk to the BCT office to catch the 9:00 tour bus. Along 
    the way we stopped at a waffle shop and I had a banana waffle. Delicious! 
    Belgium has great waffles. We boarded the tour bus and began our 3 hour drive 
    to Luxembourg City. Part way along the highway we stopped at a service center 
    and had some snacks. Then we continued on to the 
    tiny country of Luxembourg. We parked in the new part of the city and walked 
    to the old town. We were quite a bit higher in elevation than the old town 
    and stopped at an overlook where we could see down into the old town. We walked 
    down a very steep street into the historic center of the city. Our guide soothed 
    our fears indicating that we would be going back up later using an elevator. 
    We walked around the village which was very quaint. I think that it was probablly 
    the least interesting of all of the "old towns" that we had visited. 
	 We did return to the entry point of the village and found an elevator embedded in a cliff that
	 took us up 10 or more stories to the newer part of the town. There we were given an hour 
	 to browse and have lunch - it was about 2:00 by this time.

	 We circled around the restaurant area of town, but ended up at MacDonald's
	 for a burger. Force of habit? Afterwards we wandered around the public square
	 where buskers were entertaining the crowds. One interesting performance was 5 girls in 
	 yellow dresses playing zithers. Unique! When our time was up we reboarded the bus 
	 and headed back towards Brussels, but on a different highway. About an hour out from 
	 Luxembourg, we arrived at Bastogne, made famous by the Battle of the Bulge in WW-II.
	 We stopped at a huge US military memorial. It was about 5:30. We walked around 
	 the memorial which had the names of thousands of soldiers who were killed here. Very
	 moving. We were given time on our own to explore the little town. We discovered a Carrefour
	 and bought some snacks and juice. We had a two hour drive back to Brussels, arriving
	 at our hotel about 8:00. We skipped dinner, read for a while and then went to bed. Another
	 long day.

    At last! Our first relax day with nothing planned! We were up at 7:30. It was a cool 18 degrees
	and drizzled most of the day. We headed out early with our laundry, looking for a laundramat. 
	We found one, and after some help from the locals, managed to get the washing spinning.
	We popped down the road to have brunch at the Flamingo, and got back just in time to move
	the clothes into the dryer.When all was done we hiked back to the hotel. The afternoon was
	mostly dry so we walked around the Grand Place square. We also walked to the Brussels
	Central train station to check out the logistics of getting to the airport (for tomorrow). As we 
	walked back to the hotel, it rained fairly hard. We had dinner at the Brussels grill, right next 
	to our hotel. I had a beef / chicken / lamb combo. Excellent!  We did another walk around the 
	town square, then headed back to the hotel to read and sleep.

        <h3>Day 8 (July 18) - A final day in Brussels</h3>

     We were up at 7:00 for our final day in Brussels.  The forecast was for 20 degrees and rain showers.
	 Later today we would be flying to Prague. Marjorie had found a flight with Czech Airlines  that was
	 $1 Cdn plus $90 taxes. The only downside was the time - 8:00 PM tonight. We had breakfast at a 
	 nearby restaurant where I had a wonderful omelet. It was sunny and warm, so we did our usual
	 walk around the Grand Place square. Then it was back to the hotel to check out at 11:30. We had
	 them store our luggage and headed out to see some new sights. We walked to the Parc de Bruxells
	 and followed the path from one end to the other. We ended up right across from the old royal palace 
	 which was free to tour through. We spent close to an hour visiting a number of lavish ballrooms, bedrooms, 
	 sitting rooms, etc. They were furnished with original furniture, paintings and tapestries. In one of the halls 
	 they had a travelling insect display which was very interesting.

	 <p>Nearby the palace was a musical instrument
	 museum. Marjorie stayed in the entrance lobby to rest, but I 
	 decided to go through the museum. It was very interesting,
	 with lots of old European instruments plus strange instruments from cultures all over the world. Each 
	 guest was given a wireless Vox box that  played samples of music for the instrument you were 
	 standing closest to. Amazing! We walked back to the hotel (by 3:00) and had 
	 lunch / dinner at the Brussels
	 Grill (again). We picked up our luggage at about 5:00 PM. Of course it was cool and raining by this time. 
	 We trudged through the puddles to Brussels Central station and bought our train tickets to the
	 airport. The train was almost empty which made it easy to store our luggage. We said goodbye to 
	 Brussels and started the third and final leg of our trip.
