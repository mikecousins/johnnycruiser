      <p><font color="darkblue">Rating (out of 5):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship <img border="0" src="images/star5.gif" align="absmiddle">

        </font></p>
      <p>We booked this cruise for two reasons: firstly, the itinerary was marvelous and, secondly, it was a chance 
	  to try the upscale cruise line that everyone was raving about. As it turned out, the itinerary was marvelous, and
	  the ship was excellent. </p>
	  <p>The Black Sea was always a mystical place, the ports being a world away. 
        However, after reading Charles King's 
		"<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Black-Sea-History-Charles-King/dp/019928394X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278777798&amp;sr=1-1">History 
        of the Black Sea</a>", the area seemed much closer to home. As it turned 
        out, we loved every port, although the city of Constanta was generally 
        the least desireable. This was a very port intensive cruise, starting 
        with 9 consecutive ports before hitting the first (and only) sea day. 
        Couldn't complain about not visiting enough ports! For anyone following 
        along on a map, you will see that we did not just circle the perimeter 
        of the sea (which would have been the shortest route), but rather did 
        a "figure eight" route that took us twice across the middle of the Black 
        Sea.</p>
	  <p> The ship was as nice as any we have been on. However, I didn't find it to be a notch above the others as
	  we were led to believe. The ship boasted a very loyal crowd of "small ship lovers" who  shuddered at the 
	  thought of travelling on a ship with more than 700 passengers. As I always say, when you're in your stateroom, 
	  they're all the same size!  A number of others who were also first time Oceania'ers agreed with us that the 
	  advantages of a small ship (fewer lineups, more intimate feel, etc)  were offset by the 
	  missing larger ship advantages
	  (more amenities, more open space, etc). The entertainment is certainly different than the main lines.
	  It is presented in a lounge (not a theatre!). There is no troup of singers / dancers, although there is 
	  a 5 or 6 piece band. The entertainers are actually part of the cruise directors staff - no big names are 
	  brought aboard to please the passengers. The service in the dining room and cabins was wonderful, but no 
	  better than the big cruise lines. Most (including Marj) felt that the food was noticeably better, but I have loved
	  the food on previous cruises, and loved this food as well, so I would rate it a tie. The only amenities
	  not found on the regular lines are the availability of free bottled water, soda pop, fruit juices
	  and the milkshake / smoothie bar. Offsetting
	  this, internet charges and shore excursions are more expensive.
	  Oceania cruise pricing tends to be more 
	  expensive than the biggies without necessarily being a better product, so book it for the unique itinerary or
	  look for a good deal to make it worthwhile.</p>
	  <p>Be sure to look at the diary of the <a href="alaska_0607.html">Pacific 
        Princess</a> for a discussion of the ship as it is identical to the Nautica 
        (ie. old Rennaisance ship). <br>

     <p>The airport shuttle service picked us up at our home at 10:00 AM. We had a bit of a wait at the airport 
	  as our flight to Frankfurt was at 1:30 PM. The flight was about 9 hours. Our great circle route took us north 
	  of the "night line", so it was daylight all the way. May as well be, as neither of us could sleep anyway.
	  In Frankfurt we were tricked by a gate 
	  change. It's a strange airport in that all of the gate waiting rooms are locked and are only opened up
	  an hour before the flight. If you get there early, the room is locked and there's nothing to identify what
	  flight is at the gate. Anyway, we found our correct gate and had about a two hour wait.</p>
	  <p>The flight
	  to Istanbul was about  3 hours and we landed about 11:30 AM. We went straight to the visa office to buy 
	  our temporary visa, and then headed through customs. Customs was easy, and then we went to
	  the baggage carousel to get our bags. We were worried for a while in that our bags weren't there, 
	  until we realized we were at the wrong carousel! Entering the greeting area, there were crowds of people 
	  with greeting signs so I had to walk back and forth a couple of times until I located the sign with our names 
	  on it. We boarded a small van and were transported to the Arena Hotel.

      <p>The hotel was overbooked, so we were located in another building (the 
        "Otto House") one block away. It was fine. I knew that the hotel was close 
        to where we had stayed in 2006, but the Hotel Daphne was kitty-corner 
        from our room! So, we knew the area quite well. Although we were tired 
        from not sleeping, we decided to do a walk around of the area. We walked 
        across the street to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokollu_Mehmet_Pasha_Mosque">Sokollu 
        Mehmet Pasha Mosque</a>. We had done this mosque last time and loved the 
        beautiful tile work. Then we headed downhill to find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Hagia_Sophia">Kucuk 
        Ayasofya Mosque</a>. We got lost for a bit but finally located it. Once 
        again we had been there before, but just had to see this church from 527 
        AD again.</p>
	  <p>We wandered back to the hotel and I watched a bit of the World Cup Football 
        (Spain vs Switzerland). We had dinner at the hotel (lamb kabobs). Then 
        we walked about two blocks to the Hippodrome and the ancient monuments. 
        A brief walk around the Blue Mosque and the front of the Ayasofia and 
        it was time to head back to the hotel for bed. It was nice knowing our 
        way around from the previous visit, and we noticed a few things had changed. 
        The store at the corner of our hotel street was gone (turn at the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efes_Beverage_Group">Efes</a>" 
        sign) and was now a Chinese restaurant!

      </center>

      <p>Due to the time zone change, I woke up at 1:30 AM and tossed and turned until 5:30. Today we had 
	  booked a full day tour with Turista Travel. We had originally booked to do a tour to the city of Edirne, but
	  were informed just before the cruise that the trip had been cancelled. So, this tour was a last minute choice
	  and would take us the length of the Golden Horn.
	  We had an early breakfast  at the hotel and then a girl from 
	  the company met us in the lobby at 8:15. We had to walk the length of the hippodrome to their store
	  front on the main street (near the Ayasofia). We were joined by Martin, a German tourist and another guide
	  (Ufuk).</p>
	  <p>We drove along the Sea of Marmara and saw remains of the old city wall. 
        We stopped at a section of the wall called the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Constantinople#Golden_Gate_and_the_Yedikule_Fortress">Seven 
        Towers</a>", dating from the 11th century. There we climbed up to the 
        ramparts and walked around the wall. One of the towers housed a prison. 
        The view of the surrounding city was exceptional. Climbing down from the 
        walls was exciting as it was narrow stone steps with no hand railing.

	  <p>Back in the van we drove out to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chora_Church">Church 
        of the Chora</a>, built in the 5th century AD. The Chora Church was originally 
        built outside the walls of Constantinople, to the south of the Golden 
        Horn. Literally translated, the church's full name was the Church of the 
        Holy Saviour in the Country. The last part of that name, Chora, referring 
        to its location originally outside of the walls, became the shortened 
        name of the church. This is a beautiful church filled with wonderful mosaics. 
        The mosaics had been covered up by the Ottomans, but recently restored. 
		The church was very crowded, but we managed to view the entire site. There was a small
		gift shop with wonderful picture books of the church, but I resisted!

      <p>Driving further along the old city walls, we stopped at the site of the 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Porphyrogenitus">Tekfur 
        Palace</a>. The Palace was constructed during the late 12th or early 13th 
        centuries as part of the palace complex of Blachernae, where the Theodosian 
        Walls join with the later walls of the suburb of Blachernae. Only the 
        northern facade of the palace is still standing. Then we continued along 
        to the Hancerli Church which is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox 
        church in Turkey. Then it was time for lunch. We stopped at a restaurant 
        near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyüp">Eyup Mosque</a>. 
		I had lentil soup and a chicken stew (which was quite spicy).
		By this time it was very hot and humid!</p>
		<p>After lunch we took a cable car up to Pierre Loti Hill. A cemetery lined
		the slopes of the hill. At the top there was a famous restaurant, and a great view
		of the city. We were near the western end of the Golden Horn, so could look back
		the length of the horn to Topkapi and the Blue Mosque. We took the cable car
		back down again and then 
		we toured the Eyup mosque. There was a huge crowd including many 
		little boys (6 to 9 years old) dressed in fancy costumes who were about to
		be circumsized. The mosque was very busy with people praying. There was
		a long lineup for the neighbouring mausoleam (for Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, the 
		companion and standard bearer of the Prophet Muhammad)
		so we didn't go in there.

	   <p>We left the mosque and drove to a nearby ferry terminal. There we boarded the ferry and 
	   toured the length of the Golden Horn, stopping finally by the Yeni Camii (New Mosque).  The van
	   met us at the dock and we were driven back to our hotel. It was only about 3:30 PM, so we
	   did a walk around the hippodrome. On the way back we stopped into a small grocery store
	   and the girl sold me a 500 ml Efes for 1 Euro (a good price). We popped back to the hotel and 
	   then headed to the main street for dinner. We found a sidewalk cafe where I had moussaka. We
	   went back to the grocery store to get a few more beer for the ship, but the girl's father was there and
	   he sold us 4 cans for 7 Euro. Not such a good deal!</p>
	   <p>Back at the hotel I watched the France vs Mexico game and then it was time for bed.

      <p>Today was embarkation day, so we had nothing planned in the way of tours. 
	  Oh yes, it was also my birthday - the big 6-oh! We woke up
	  about 5:30 AM and read for a while. Breakfast was served at 7:00. The hotel restaurant (outdoor)
	  was on the street level and several small cats were roaming around. One was so friendly he 
	  kept jumping up on my chair as I was eating. Breakfast was typical Turkish - tomatoes, cucumber,
	  yoghurt, cheese, breads and cereals. Very nice!</p>
	  <p>Because the ship was overnighting in Istanbul, there was no hurry to 
        board and, in fact, our boarding docs suggested not before 3:00 PM. Marj 
        overheard a group in the lobby who had a shuttle van booked for 2:00 and 
        asked if we could join them. Transfer solved. We walked to the hippodrome, 
        viewed the historic columns, admired the views of the Blue Mosque and 
        Ayasofia, visited the public fountain at the Topkapi gates and ended up 
        down the street at the entrance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gülhane_Park">
		Gulhane  Park</a>.

      <p>We had not been in this park before, so strolled along a wide pathway through 
        the trees and flowers. It was a beautiful park. We must have spent an 
        hour or so walking the length of the pathway and back again. It was very 
        peaceful in the park. Then we wandered back through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople">hippodrome</a> 
        again on our way to the hotel. We stopped to take photos of two of the 
        monuments - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_Obelisk">Walled 
        Obelisk</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk_of_Theodosius">Obelisk 
        of Thutmose III</a>. Then we continued on to our hotel room. There, we 
        packed our bags and then sat and read for a while. At lunch time we wandered 
        out into the streets looking for a place to eat. We found a sandwich shop 
        (the Saray Bufe) on a little side street, and the owner pulled us in and 
        showed us what we could have. Marj didn't want to have anything, but the
		guy misunderstood me and prepared two sandwiches when I had only ordered one.
		So we each had a "Gyro" chicken sandwich which was 
        very good. After lunch it was time to retrace our steps past the Blue 
        Mosque to meet our 2:00 pickup at the hotel.

		<p>It was a short ride to the docks and we walked straight onto the ship. There was no 
		checkin at the terminal. Instead, we were sent to the Nautica Lounge where we checked in onboard.
		Now that is service!
		We were the only ones checking in so it went quickly. We checked out our room and then 
		headed to the buffet for some fruit and a drink. Then we wandered the ship seeing how it 
		compared to the Pacific Princess (identical ship). Dinner was "anytime dining", from 6:30 to 9:30.
		Even 6:30 was later than we normally liked to dine, so we were usually one of the first to arrive each 
		night. Tonight I had the seafood stirfry which was excellent. We wandered around the ship for a 
		while (no entertainment was scheduled) and went to be early. It was a wonderful birthday.</p>
		<p>We weren't the only ship in town. Docked right behind us was the Equinox (which we had 
		done to the Holyland last year), plus the Sea Spirit and the Wind Spirit.
		
      <p><b>Note:</b> One nice perk on Oceania is that every cabin has a DVD player. The ship 
	  boasts a huge repertoire of DVD movies that you can borrow (free of charge) at any time. We
	  never used this offering due to our port intensive schedule. We just didn't have time!

        <h3>Day 2 (Jun 19) - A second day in Istanbul</h3>
      </center>

	  <p>We were still waking up early (about 5:30), so 
	  we enjoyed the upper deck in the morning sun. 
	  There was lots of boat traffic on the Bosphorus, and the city looked beautiful
	  bathed in the early morning sun. Today
	  we had a full day tour that was organized by one of the Cruise Critic folks. We had breakfast
	  at 7:00. Being a small ship, the buffet service area was a bit cramped, but there never seemed to
	  be long lineups for toast or omelettes. I ended up having an omelette  "with everything" almost
	  every morning. After a couple of mornings, the omelette guy knew exactly what I wanted 
	  without me asking. We met for the tour at 8:15. The tour bus was a 20 seater van, but there 
	  were only 10 of us, so we had lots of room.

      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_20.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>We headed off over the Galata Bridge, up the Bosphorus coast and then 
        over the Bosphorus Bridge to the Asian side of the city. We drove up to 
        a hillside park called Buyuk Camlica . The park is high up and affords 
        a wonderful view looking across the Bosphorus to the European side of 
        the city. We had visited this park in 2006 and the main pathway had been 
        lined with <a href="http://www.inspiringcities.org/index.php?id=18406&amp;type=article">book 
        benches</a> in the shape of open books, with printed excerpts from famous 
        Turkish writers and poets. This time they were all gone. We had seen one 
        of the benches two days earlier on our first tour which had surprised 
        me. It must be like the Calgary Cow competition several years ago where 
        the fiberglas cows dispersed throughout the city after the event. We had
		a lovely time walking around the park. Last time it was cloudy and cool, this
		time it was sunny and warm (ie. hot).

      <p>We headed back down from the park and stopped at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beylerbeyi_Palace">Beylerbeyi 
        Palace</a> which is right under the Asian side of the Bosphorus Bridge.  Of course the bridge was not there when the palace
		was built. Beylerleyi Palace was commissioned by Sultan Abdulaziz (1830 -1876) 
		and built between 1861 and 1865 as a summer residence and a place to entertain 
		visiting heads of state. We were given an appointed time to enter the palace, and spent 
		our short wait walking arount the grounds and along the waterfront. In the old days, all of the
		visitors would arrive by boat, so there were some fancy boat houses and entrance gates
		along the water. The palace was beautiful inside with lots of paintings, original furniture,
		chandeliers, etc. After a bit more of a wander around the grounds (and a pit stop), we
		reboarded the bus and headed north up the Bosphorus shoreline. There were some
		gorgeous (and expensive) houses along the route.

      <p>We stopped at a ferry terminal and left the bus. Across the street was 
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihrimah_Mosque">Mihrimah Sultan 
        Mosque</a>. We risked everything crossing the busy street and entered 
        the mosque. The Mihrimah Sultan Mosque was designed by Mimar Sinan ("Sinan the Architect") 
		for the favorite daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent, Princess Mihrimah. Its building took place 
		from 1562 to 1565.The courtyard had been converted to a medical clinic. The
		interior of the mosque was beautiful. We had about a half hour to explore the mosque
		and then we ran back across the street and bought tickets for the ferry. The ferry ride
		was about half an hour and we arrived at the Yeni Mosque terminal ready for lunch. 
		We walked across the plaza to the Hamdi Restaurant. I had ground lamb kebabs
		and they were the best I had ever had. Absolutely yummy!!

	  <p>After lunch we visited the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rüstem_Pasha_Mosque">Rustem 
        Pasha Mosque</a>, which we had seen on our previous trip to Istanbul (2006). 
		The mosque was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for Grand Vizier 
		Damat Rustem Pasha (husband of one of the daughters of Suleiman the Magnificent, 
		Princess Mihrimah). Its building took place from 1561 to 1563.The
		interior is covered in beautiful Iznik tiles. </p>
		<p>Then it was time to visit the Church of the Chora, which was our only repeat from the tour 2 days ago.
		We didn't want to go in the church again, so instead just browsed around some shops across the
		street from the church. Finally we headed towards Sultanahmet and did a quick foray into the Grand Bazaar.
		The bazaar is huge, covering many city blocks and containing over 4,000 stores! You
		could get lost forever in there! We headed back to the ship and arrived about 6:00 PM. Lifeboat
		drill was at 5:15, so we had missed it. That's fine! I had rack of lamb for dinner, but the ship did not
		have mint sauce - unheard of! We skipped the entertainment and went to bed early.
		The ship was sailing at 11:00 PM, so we were fast asleep by then. We talked to others 
		later who
		saw all the city lights and the transit under the two Bosphorus bridges. Sleep
		was good too.

        <h3>Day 3 (Jun 20) - Nessebur, Bulgaria</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_29.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_30.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>I woke up at our usual early time and, lo and behold, we were in Bulgaria. 
        The ship was heading in to the harbour at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesebar">Nessebur</a>. 
        The town is similar to Tallinn and Dubrovnik as there is a (very) old 
        town separated from the new town. In this case "old" Nessebur is on a 
        peninsula (almost an island) attached to the new city. Originally a Thracian 
        settlement known as Menebria, the town became a Greek colony when settled 
        by Dorians from Megara at the beginning of the 6th century BC, and was 
        an important trading centre from then on.</p>
	  <p>We had joined a private tour for the day with a group from Cruise Critic. There were 10 of us.
	  This was the only port that we had to tender, so we met at 8:45
	  and proceeded to the tendering station. Arriving at the pier about 9:00, we met our guide for the day.
	  It was only a short walk from the pier to the old town. Along the docking area we saw the Michail
	  Lomonosov, a large Viking River Cruises ship. I talked to one of the staff and he told me they do 
	  Odessa, Yalta and up the Dnepr River to Kiev. It was 5 decks high, so obviouslu did not 
	  encounter any low bridges in its travels. Our first stop was at the archaeological museum. It was
	  very good, with objects dating back thousands of years. 
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_31.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_32.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>After spending some time in the museum, we did a walking tour of the old town. The town was a
	  mix of souvenir / handicraft shops, restaurants and old Byzantine churches. We explored several 
	  of the old churches, all of them in ruins or restored but not in use. [Visited St Sofia (old Bishopric) - 5th century,
	  Church of John the Baptist - 11th century, Church of St. Theodore - 13th century, Church of Christ Pantocrator  -
	  13th century, Church of St John Aliturgetos - 14th century]. It was a beautiful blue sky day and the
	  Byzantine structures looked  amazing, bathed in the sun's glow. We spent about  one and a half
	  hours walking around the old town. It was very hot, so we headed for any shade we could find when
	  listening to the guide. We walked back to the entrance gates of the old town and our van was waiting for us.
	  It was about 11:30 and we were off to the country to visit a monastery and do a wine tasting.

      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_34.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>We drove south along the coast towards Pomorie. Out in nowhere we came upon the Monastery 
	  of Sveti Georgi (St. George). There was a church, a chapel, a bell tower and a residence
	  building. There was a baptism happening in the church with lots of young people attending.
	  The monks support the monastery by making and selling a type of brandy (can't remember
	  the flavour). We were invited in for a tasting, but it turned out that they didn't have any serving
	  glasses, and everyone just drank from a shared, small vial. We all said "no thanks" and headed
	  back out into the courtyard. </p>
	  <p>From there we drove to a group of beautiful seaside hotels where a wine tasting was set up for us.
	  This time we had real glasses, and a plate each of sliced meats and cheeses. The wine was 
	  pleasant and the food was delicious. Then it was time to drive back to the ship. We caught the
	  tender back to the ship and were onboard by about 3:00 PM. We hadn't really
	  had lunch, so headed to the milkshake bar for a chocolate banana shake. Oceania provides
	  shakes, malteds and smoothies for free!. This night we had dinner at the Polo Grill specialty
	  restaurant. (The Polo Grill and Toscana Restaurant are free of charge. Passengers get one 
	  guaranteed seating in each restaurant and after that it is subject to availability). I had
	  a huge lobster. It was delicious. We skipped the entertainment and headed to bed early.
	  It was a great day and now I've seen everything there is to see in Bulgaria.

        <h3>Day 4 (Jun 21) - Constanta, Romania</h3>
      </center>

      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_36.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>Another day, another country. We woke up early again to watch the ship 
        come into Constanta Harbour. An omelette "with everything" was consumed 
        at 7:00 AM. This time we were doing a ship's tour, and met in the lounge 
        at 8:00. It was a big bus of about 40 people. We did a bit of a tour 
        through the city of Constanta. It was a mix of newer buildings and crumbling 
        Soviet era cement buildings. All in all, it wasn't a pleasant city. We 
        drove north up the coast for just over an hour and came to the ancient 
        Greek/Roman town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histria_(Sinoe)">Histria</a>. 
        The countryside was very interesting. There was a mix of industry and 
        agriculture. Some of the industrial complexes seemed abandoned, while 
        others were active. We arrived at Histria just after 9:00. Ancient Histria or Istros 
		(Thracian river god, Danube), was a Greek colony or polis (city) on the 
	  Black Sea coast, established by Milesian settlers to trade with the native Getae. It became the first 
	  Greek town on the present day Romanian territory.
	  <br clear=left>

      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_38.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>The first activity we did at 
	  Histria was touring an excellent archaeological museum. The rooms were
	  very large and everything was nicely displayed. Most of the artifacts were from the Greek (3rd 
	  - 1st centuries BC) and the Roman era (1st to 3rd centuries AD). Then, we left the museum
	  and wandered through the ruins of the ancient city. It was very hot and humid! The largest ruin was that 
	  of a Bishopric Basilica (Byzantine) from the 6th century AD.
	  Very near the site were a few modern houses, and there was a stork's nest
	  upon a power pole. Storks are huge!</p>
	  <p>We drove back into town and visited a folklore museum, with a vast collection 
        of native clothing. It was very interesting. We were back to the ship 
        by 12:30, and had a chinese buffet (what does that have to do with Romania?) 
        and a malted milk. After lunch we wandered out to the terminal building 
        on the dock where they had free wi-fi. Marj did her Cruise Desk stuff 
        qand then we read for a while. We decided to go to trivia at 4:30 where 
        we met a New Zealand couple (Peter and Halcyon) who would become good 
        friends throughout the cruise. That's one big plus about cruising that 
        you meet so many wonderful people! We actually won and got 3 <font color="#FF0000">Big-O 
        Points</font> for each team member. The points could be collected throughout 
        the cruise and then cashed in for awesome treasures like t-shirts and 
        ball caps.</p>
		<p>For dinner I had beef tenderloin - yum! Then we did the evening 
        trivia (more <font color="#FF0000">Big-O Points</font>). We actually stayed 
		up for the entertainment (Polish violinist) and didn't hit the hay until 10:30.
		It was a really great day. I'm glad we didn't just walk around Constanta for the day as we
		heard some bad feedback from several passengers. A number of passengers had
		been robbed in various incidents ashore. Not a nice or safe city!

        <h3>Day 5 (Jun 22) - Odessa, Ukraine</h3>
      </center>

      <p>Today we arrived in the Ukraine. We were up early as usual and wached 
        the ship dock in the harbour. 7:00 AM was once again omelette time. We 
        had booked a tour of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa">Odessa</a> 
        through the ship but Marj had decided a couple of days ago that she couldn't 
        handle so many tours in a row. So, she had cancelled and I was going it 
        on my own (with 40 others!). Marj walked around the town (much safer than 
        Constanta) while I headed off on the bus (9:00 AM). We drove through the 
        town passing a number of beautiful buildings and statues of local dignitaries. 
        Our first stop was at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_Stairs">Potemkin 
        Steps</a> where "The Battleship Potemkin" was filmed in 1925 by the great Russian
		director Sergei Eisenstein.  The steps are built such that from the bottom you see only steps, and
		from the top you see only landings.

	  <p>We walked a few blocks from the steps and came to the Odessa Opera House. What an amazing building!
	  Then we bused it to the memorial to the unknown sailor. Today was June 22 which is the day the Nazis 
	  invaded Odessa. There is an annual memorial on this date and the cenotaph was covered in wreaths.
	  5 high school students in uniform guarded the monument, and a TV station was filming the events. Then we
	  drove to the Uspensky Cathedral, but could only enter the chapel in the basement as a service of some sort 
	  was being held in the main part of the church. Finally we visited an art museum featuring some famous 18th
	  and 19th century Ukrainian artists.</p>
	  <p>We were back at the ship by 1:00 PM. Marjorie arrived back shortly after, 
        and had seen some of the same things we saw on the tour. The town is quite 
        walkable! We had lunch and then went back out to the dock area which featured 
        a large paving stone square with sculptures, canons, etc. It was quite 
        hot there, so we went back into the ship to read for a while. Trivia with 
        P&H was at 4:30, then off to dinner. I had a seafood stirfry which was 
        excellent. We did the 8:45 trivia for more <font color="#FF0000">Big-O 
        Points</font>, but skipped the entertainment (comedian). Off to bed at 
        10:00. Another wonderful day. <b>Note</b>: Our daily newsletter has
		been forecasting rain every day, but so far we've had scattered cloud, sun
		and hot, hot, hot!

        <h3>Day 6 (Jun 23) - Sevastopol, Ukraine</h3>

      <p>Today would be our second day in the Ukraine. Overnight we had relocated to Sevastopol.
	  Up early, we walked the upper deck as we approached the harbour. Sevastopol is the HQ of the 
	  Russian navy, so there were lots of grey ships at dock. As an aside, the whole of Crimea and
	  some of southern Ukraine is of Russian heritage. The locals speak Russian and the schools are
	  taught in Russian. A bit like Quebec is to English speaking Canadians. So, even though we were
	  in the Ukraine, it felt like being in Russia.</p>
	  <p>We were booked for a private tour (6 people) and boarded a small van 
        at 9:00 AM. The van was very basic - no A/C or even opening windows. It 
        was certainly the worst transportation we have ever had on a private tour. 
        We drove through the town and stopped at a building called "<a href="http://sevastopol.russian-women.net/Panorama.shtml">The 
        Panorama</a>". Inside the circular domed building, was a 360 degree panarama 
        of the <a href="http://englishrussia.com/index.php/2008/05/26/the-sevastopol-defense-panorama/">Defense 
        of Sevastopol </a>from the vantage point of the Russian encampment on 
        "the mound" (a large hill). From the viewing platform outwards, real foxholes, 
        encampments, barricades, canons, etc were visible. At some point, the ground meets 
        the fabrick of the dome on which the remainder of the battle scene is 
        painted. The transition is done so well that you couldn't tell where reality 
        ended and the painting began. It was absolutely amazing and put you in 
        the center of the battle.

      <p>After leaving the panorama, we drove a short distance to the actual hill 
        where the battle occured. All the trees and singing birds made it difficult 
        to imaging the war horrors, but the long range view was the same. Then 
        we headed to the harbour to see the monument to the "scuttled ships". 
        During the Crimean war, Admiral Nakhimov (Russian) scuttled the Russian 
        navy ships so that the French and English troops could not capture them. 
        Then it was back to the cruise ship, arriving about 1:15. Fortunately, no one had scuttled it! 
		We headed aboard for 
        some lunch and milkshakes. For most of the afternoon we sat out on the 
        promenade deck and watched the boat traffic in the harbour. It was a beautiful 
        sunny afternoon. Trivia with P&H was at 4:30 (more <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O 
        Points</font>). For dinner I had prime rib. It was excellent. Late trivia was at 9:15.
		The entertainment was a singer (country & western), but we didn't go.</p>
		
      <p><b>Off Topic Note</b>: I have been watching the World Cup games just 
        before dinner each night. The ship is picking up the games from a Turkish 
        station called TRTT. The announcing, commercials, etc are all in Turkish. 
        The time clock / score bar widget on the screen shows the three letter 
        abbreviations of the competing teams, based on the Turkish names of the 
        countries. It was fun trying to guess who was playing. For example, one 
        time it showed "YUN". I couldn't figure out what country that was. It 
        turned out to be Greece. The Turkish name for Greece is Yunanistan.

      <p>Overnight we had crossed the center of the Black Sea from North to South. Up at
	  6:00, we watched the ship dock at Sinop. It was quite overcast, but supposed to clear up later. It did!
	  We were booked for a private tour with some CC folks. There were 10 of us who met at 8:45
	  ready for our 9:00 departure. The guide met us at the ship with a comfortable van with A/C!
	  The town of Sinop is on a peninsula (called the Sinop Peninsula). We drove through the town and
	  on to the mainland, passing through the Pasha Bastions - gates and walls built to stop sea
	  raids in the 19th century. We passed out of the town and drove up the slopes of an adjacent hill. 
	  Our first stop was looking down at a small black sand beach, then further on we stopped for a 
	  panoramic view of the city.
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_49.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290">

      <p>After taking some pictures of the city (and the cruise ship), we headed back down the hill
	  and into the city. There we stopped at the Sinop Archaeological Museum. The museum was
	  excellent and covered the Greek and Roman periods, as well as the Byzantine and Ottoman 
	  eras. Outside there were lots of Greek / Roman remnants, plus grave markers from an
	  Ottoman period cemetery. Leaving the museum, we drove to another one - the Sinop
	  Ethnographical Museum. This was in a three story wooden house which was typical of the
	  upper class homes. Two of the floor were open and the rooms had been decorated (including manikins)
	  in the original style. There were rooms for men and rooms for women. Very interesting!
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_53.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="270" height="370"> 
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_51.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>After leaving the museums, we drove to the Alaaddin Mosque complex. Across the street
	  was the Muslim Theological School (Medrese),
	  which was built by the Seljuk vizier Suleyman Pervane 
	  upon his victory over Sinop in 1262. It is now a market place so we were given a chance to
	  do a bit of shopping or have some tea. We weren't intrested in shopping, so just
	  sat down and rested. It was interesting watching the locals shop. 
	  Then we walked to the mosque across the street.
	  The Alaaddin Mosque was a five dome-shaped building built in 1214 
	  during the Seljuk period.
	  The mosque had been recently renovated. The interior was just white plaster - no
	  decoration at all. This was very unusual for a mosque! Maybe it was waiting to be
	  decorated as part of the renovation. In the courtyard, a group of children were 
	  playing soccer, ignoring the flower gardens and ancient monuments. There
	  was a large public fountain in the center of the courtyard, covered by a wooden roof
	  - again unusual decor for a mosque.

      <p>Then we drove west to the northernmost tip of Turkey. We stopped at an 
        inlet of water called the Hamsilos Fjord. It was only a kilometer or two 
        long, so in Norway would not qualify as a fjord! The fjord widened out 
        into Ak Liman Bay. Nearby, we stopped at an ourdoor restaurant for lunch. 
        They had a good selection of food (I had kebabs) and the prices were resonable. 
        I ordered a <b>dark</b> Efes beer, but received the Pilsen version. I don't
		think the waiter understood what I was asking. It was very nice sitting outdoors 
		overlooking the ocean. Then it was time to head back into town.

      <p>After winding back through the town, we arrived at the waterfront. Right near the ship were
	  the old  town walls, and the south Sinop Castle. We scrambled up the stairs and were rewarded 
	  with a wonderful view of the waterfront and the city (and the ship!). At the base of the castle were 
	  some handicraft stores, two of them being wooden model ship shops. The small
	  models were amazing. No room in my suitcase though.</p>
	  <p>Saying goodby to our tour guide, we headed aboard in time for 5:00 PM 
        trivia. Tonight we were booked for Toscana. I had veal picatta and it 
        was really good. We played 8:45 trivia (love those <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O 
        Points</font>), skipped the entertainment and headed to bed. <br clear=left>

      <p>Our second day in Turkey found us in the city of Trabzon. We rose early 
        and watched the ship come into port. It was going to be another hot and 
        humid day! 7:00 was omelette time. I've really been enjoying my daily 
        omelette. I also have a variety of cut up fruit with it. Yum! Today we 
        were on another private tour, with the same guide, Eylem, that we had 
        on the second full day in Istanbul. He was very good, so we were pleased 
        to have him again. The 12 of us boarded a 20 passenger van and headed 
        south into the mountains. It was beautiful, much like the BC mountains. 
        As we headed up, the hot and humid was replaced with cool and dry. Alongside 
        us was a rushing mountain stream. After an hour or so we came to a lookout 
        point from which we could see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sümela_Monastery">Sumela 
        Monastery</a> hanging from a cliff. Lying at an altitude of approximately 
        1200 metres, it is a major tourist attraction of Altindere National Park. 
        Founded in the year 386 AD during the reign of the Emperor Theodosius 
        I (375 - 395) legend has it that two priests undertook the founding of 
        the monastery on the site after having discovered a miraculous icon of 
        the Virgin Mary in a cave on the mountain. 
		<br clear=right>
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_58.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290">

      <p>The trail to the monastery was quite tricky - some spots were just dirt and tree roots. 
	  One fellow in our group tripped and fell, dislocating his shoulder. He had to visit the hospital 
	  in the afternoon to have it reset. Along the pathway was a Turkish peasant playing a violin-like 
	  instrument call a Karadeniz Kemencesi. Someone took my picture sitting beside him.
	  Once we got to the base of the monastery, we had to climb 
	  two steep sets of stairs to the entrance. From a distance one can only see the tall buildings that 
	  look like they are flush to the cliff wall. However, there is a huge cavelike structure behind in which 
	  there is a small town. The Rock Church was especially interesting, covered with 
	  religious frescos inside and out. We were given about an hour to explore all the little buildings and 
	  check out the view overlooking the valley. It was really an amazing complex. Leaving the monastery
	  behind we headed back along the mountain road.

      <p>Part way down we stopped at a hotel/restaurant beside the mountain stream 
        for tea. Then we continued back into Trabzon. There our destination was 
        the summer home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atatürk">Ataturk</a>, 
        Turkey's national hero. The mansion and gardens were really beautiful. 
        From there, the van dropped us off for lunch at the ship. I don't know 
        who orchestrated this, but it was kind of nice to be able to "freshen 
        up" and have lunch on board. After an hour, we were picked up by the van 
        to continue our tour. We travelled through town to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia,_Trabzon">Hagia 
        Sophia</a> Church. The Hagia Sophia, now the Hagia Sophia Museum, is a former church 
		and mosque located in the city of Trabzon. It dates back to the 13th century when 
		Trabzon was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond. It was an interesting church with beautiful
		ceiling frescos.</p>
		<p>Then it was a stop at the downtown section of Trabzon for a bit of shopping. All we got 
		was a jar of hazelnut spread. The streets were packed with local shoppers and it was interesting
		to watch them buzzing about, some in traditional garb, but carrying bags of Western
		electronics, etc. Then it was back to the ship. There was no afternoon trivia today.
		Instead, they had a folkloric show with a local Turkish musician and dance group. We
		didn't stay for the whole show, but it was pretty good.
		For dinner I had shrimp stirfry. We managed 8:45 trivia, but skipped the singer and went to bed.
		Another wonderful day! We had to put our clocks ahead one hour tonight for Russia.

        <h3>Day 9 (Jun 26) - Sochi, Russia</h3>

      <p>At last we made it to the city of the 2014 Olympics. Yes, today we arrived 
        in Russia, at the port of Sochi. We woke up an hour late, but this was 
        probably because we had put our clocks forward. Breakfast was at 7:00 and 
        then we met for the private tour at 9:15. 12 of us boarded the van at 
        9:30 with a pleasant guide who spoke excellent English. Sochi was a real 
        surprise as it was sub-tropical, with beautiful tree-lined streets, well 
        kept buildings and parkland along the ocean front. It was obviously the 
        playground of the Russian rich and famous. Our first stop was at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Michael%27s_Cathedral,_Sochi">Cathedral 
        of St. Michael the Archangel</a>. This church is the oldest Orthodox church 
        in Sochi and the entire Black Sea Oblast of the former Russian Empire. 
        Its construction was decreed by Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia 
        with a view to commemorating the victorious conclusion of the prolonged 
        Caucasian War in 1864. There were actually several buildings including 
		a gazebo, a baptistry and a sunday school. We couldn't go in the church
		as there was a service in progress.

		<p>A short drive away, we parked and did a walk along the oceanfront.
		The whole area was a park with trees and paving stones. The buildings 
		were modern and well-kept. At the end of the walk we came upon the 
		museum of art. The Sochi Art Museum occupies a large building with 
		a four-columned portico, completed in 1939. The elegant Neoclassical design 
		is considered to be the masterpiece of Ivan Zholtovsky.</p>
		<p>We walked back along the same path to the waiting bus. Besides seing
		various palm trees, there were the most gorgeous magnolia trees with
		blossoms that must have been almost a foot in diameter. We had seen similar
		trees in Australia.

	  <P>We drove out of the city a bit to a mineral water spa called Matsesta. There
	  are numerous spas (or sanitariums) that have been built in the area to take
	  advantage of the natural mineral waters. From
	  their own description:</p>
		
      <p><i>Matsesta, meaning 'fire water', has harnessed the powers of the hot 
        sulphur springs that have become synonymous with Sochi and become the 
        city's most renowned health spa. The water contains over 27 types of minerals 
        and is used to treat people with respiratory and cardiac problems. Featuring 
        a number of bathing rooms, massage tables and inhalation cubicles, Matsesta 
        Spa is a major tourist attraction.</i></p>
		<p>After visiting the spa, we drove to a mansion that was Stalin's Dacha or
		summer home. It was spartan inside (the way Stalin kept it) and the cement exterior
		was stained green for camouflage from the air (Stalin was paranoid). It seemed grim to
		me knowing what Stalin had done to his people, but it is still part of the Russian history.

	  <P>For the final part of the tour, we drove to Riviera Park. Just by the entrance to the park
	  is the "Tree of Friendship" garden where magnolia trees have been planted by astronauts,
	  cosmonauts, foreign dignitaries, famous people, etc. Next to this is a large garden / fountain
	  memorial to the doctors and nurses that worked in the sanitariums during the Great War.</p>
	  <p>Riviera Park was the closest thing I have seen to Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. 
        It has roller coasters, ferris wheels and other rides, beautiful gardens, 
        restaurants, photo places with period costumes, and more! Walking through 
        the park we met Disney and spongebob characters mixing with the children. 
        What a park! Then it was back to the ship in time for a late lunch (milkshake) 
        and afternoon trivia (more <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O Points</font>). For dinner
		I had the roast turkey. There was no evening trivia due to a special "From Russia with Love"
		sales event, so we wandered the ship and watched 
		the soccer match. (By the way, we're in the same timezone as South Africa, so we see the
		games at the same time as they are scheduled in SA.)
		It was another wonderful day. We set the clocks back an hour tonight getting
		ready for the Ukraine tomorrow.

      <p>Clocks back, an extra hour's sleep! Yeah right - up at 5:30 to watch 
        the ship come into port. This was our last Black Sea port (and the 9th 
        port in a row!). We had our usual breakfast at 7:00, and then got ready 
        for our tour. We had booked another private tour with some CC folks. We 
        met in the atrium at 8:15 and boarded the van at 8:30. There were 10 of 
        us in the large van, and our guide was very good. We were back on the 
        Crimean Peninsula so Yalta, despite being in the Ukraine, was very Russian. 
        As we disembarked from the ship, there was our friend, the Mikhail Lomonosov 
        docked with us again. We loaded into the van and drove to our first stop 
        at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livadia_Palace">Livadia Palace</a>. 
		This is the place where the Yalta Conference was held as Roosevelt, Churchill
		and Stalin divvied up post-war Europe. The palace was interesting, but there were
		very few original furnishings due to its use as a mental hospital during the
		Communist years. However, there were lots of photos relating to the Yalta
		Conference.

	  <P>Leaving the palace, we boarded the van and drove along the coast. Our next stop was
	  a viewpoint overlooking the famous Swallow's Nest Castle. The building is a decorative 
	  castle, built between 1911 and 1912 near Gaspra. It is on top of 40-meter (130 ft) high Aurora Cliff, 
	  constructed to a Neo-Gothic design by the Russian architect Leonid Sherwood. The lookout area 
	  was a mass of souvenir stalls and fast food booths. Very commercial! The area was really
	  packed with people too, as Viking Cruises had several of their own large tour buses there.</p>
	  <p>Next we travelled on to the small resort town of Alupka, and the
        <a href="http://www.mapofukraine.net/crimean_peninsula/vorontsov_castle/alupka_palace.html">Vorontsov 
        Palace</a>. Mikhail Vorontsov was governor of southern Russia (which included also the 
		Crimean peninsula) in the early 19th century. Vorontsov's Castle, built in five different 
		architectural styles (actually different from each side) is well kept and has a small art gallery.
		The rooms were beautifully decorated as this palace did not suffer the indignity of 
		being converted into a hospital.
		Churchill stayed at this palace during the Yalta Conference.

	  <P>After tromping around the palace grounds, we were on the road again, 
        this time headed to the home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov">Anton 
        Chekhov</a>. Chekhov is well-known for his short fiction and plays, particularly 
        <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>, <i>The Three Sisters</i>, and <i>The Bishop</i>. 
		The home was quite small (after the palaces). During WWII, the house was spared destruction
		by the Nazis because there was some kind of connection between Chekhov and Hitler
		(via marriages and relatives). The surrounding gardens were quite interesting as Chekhov loved trees 
		and had planted many unique species in the garden.</p>
		<p>Our final destination was the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, a large orthodox church.
		It was bright white with shiny gold onion domes. With the blue sky behind it, it sparkled
		like a giant gem. There was a small group of people sitting in the courtyard singing
		a religious choral work. It was awesome! We had about half an hour there, but I could 
		have stayed all day looking at the church and listening to the music!</p>
		
      <p>We were back at the ship for a late lunch, and then on to 3:30 trivia. 
        We were still enjoying playing with Peter and Halcyon, and wouldn't have 
        scored nearly as well without them. We really owed them big time for our 
		<font color="#FF0000">BIG-O Points</font>! We had dinner at the
		main dining room, and I had the ??? - oh man, I can't remember. Time to get
		off the ship! I've cruised too much! We did the evening trivia then off
		to bed.

      <p>Today we woke up to - what? - a "day at sea". Yahoo! After 9 days in 
        a row of doing tours (11 actually counting Istanbul), today was to be 
        a day of rest. We actually slept in a bit and got up about 7:00 AM. We 
        had breakfast and then sat on the promenade deck to read. It was a glorious 
        sunny day. From approximately 9:00 to 10:30 AM we would be sailing down the 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>
		(in the daylight!!), so we 
        went to the upper deck to watch the passage. Marjorie stood in one of 
        the cabanna units (looking forward) while I was at the railing
		looking off to the starboard 
        side. The morning sun was shining from the Asian side
		(east), so the best lighting 
        for pictures was on the European side. The Bosphorus is about 30 km long
		and averages about 1 km wide - so you are never far from either side.
		The straight is just that - fairly straight, so from the Black Sea entrance 
		(north end) one can see Istanbul at the south end. </p>
		<p>I was lucky I went up early to get a railing spot as it filled up quickly. I got
		lots of pictures of the houses, palaces and mosques along the way. The only 
		problem with holding my railing spot is that I wasn't able to run to the port side
		when passing the Asian Fortress and the Beylerbeyi Palace. Oh well, you 
		can't see it all! It was wonderful as we passed the Sultanahmet area of the city. 
		I could pick out Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, the
		Yeni Mosque, the Suleymaniye Mosque, and even Gulhane park,
		where we had walked a week earlier. It was a gorgeous site! Then we
		sailed out into the sea of Marmara and the shorelines became lost in
		the haze.

	  <P>We read some more and then went for lunch. After lunch I watched a soccer 
        match and then wandered around the ship. At 4:30 it was trivia time - 
        more <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O Points</font> for all. From 5:00 to 6:00 PM
        we would be sailing through the Dardenelles so we headed out to the promenade 
        deck (shaded) and stood with Peter and Halcyon as we sailed from 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli">Gallipoli 
        </a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çanakkale">Canakkale</a>. 
		Along the way were several fortresses, plus war memorials to Turkey, England
		and France. The ANZAC memorial was not visible to us. Some day we will have to 
		do an excursion to Canakkale to see the memorials up close.</p>
		<p>As we sailed out of the Dardenalles and into the Mediteranean Ocean
		(also called the Aegean Sea locally), we headed off to dinner. I had lamb shank.
		Very good! There was another trivia session at 8:45. Can't remember if we won anything
		or not. Wandered around the ship some more and then headed to bed.
		It was really nice to have such a relaxing day for once.

        <h3>Day 12 (Jun 29) - Kusadasi, Turkey</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_81.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_82.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>Woke up early this morning and it was back to our regular schedule. We 
        headed up to the upper deck to watch the ship dock in Kusadasi. This would 
        be our third time to Kusadasi. The fortress island in the harbour looked 
        awesome in the morning sun. There were several ships in port, including 
        the Splendor of the Seas, and the Equinox. Breakfast was at 7:00 as usual. 
        We had a ship's tour booked and met at 8:00 AM in the Nautica Lounge. 
        We were going south to visit two ancient Greek / Roman sites call Miletus 
        and Didyma. We headed out to the bus. This tour musn't have been popular 
        as there were only about 15 of us on a bus for 45. We had lots of room! 
        The drive south took about an hour. We passed through the village of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priene">Priene</a> 
        (but didn't stop) along the way. Finally we came to the site of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletus">Miletus</a>. Miletus is
		an ancient city dating back thousands of years. However, the bulk of
		the ruins that we walked through are Greek or Roman, with some later
		Byzantine buildings as well. The most complete (and largest) structure was
		a Roman theatre. We enjoyed seeing the layout of the city, but it was very hot and humid.
		Phew! After returning to the bus parking area, we browsed some souvenir booths nearby. 
		Marjorie bought a small decorated candy dish as a momento. Then it was back
		in the bus and off to Didyma.

      <img src="images/diary_black_0610/photo_black_0610_84.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="270" height="370"> 
	  <P>It was only a short distance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didyma">Didyma</a>. 
        Whereas Miletus was a town, Didyma was a religious site. We parked the 
        bus a short distance away and had to walk along a village road to the 
        site. As it came into view I could see that it was enormous. The site 
        is actually a single temple that is the largest Greeek temple that I can 
        remember seeing. It reminded me of the Luxor and Karnak temples in Egypt. 
        The temple was not completed (6th century BC), and had been destroyed 
        by the Persians in 494 BC. However, enough of the structure is remaining 
        to show the awesome dimensions of the temple. We spent another hour exploring 
        the ruins, plus did a bit of shopping at some nearby stores. Then it was 
        time to get back into the air conditioned bus (yahoo!) and drive back 
        to Kusadasi. We elected not to stay in town as we had toured the local 
        streets twice before. Instead we headed back onto the ship for a late 
        lunch and milkshake. The final "payout" trivia was at 4:00 PM, and at 
        5:00 PM there was a session to cash in <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O Points</font> 
        for merchandise. Marjorie and I pooled our points and had enough to 
		purchase a t-shirt!! Woohoo!! Plus we had points left over that Marjorie is 
		saving for our next Oceania cruise in November. For dinner I had seafood stuff.
		It was excellent. Then we had a final non-payout trivia session at 8:45 - just for fun!
		Then it was time for a wander outside, then off to bed.

        <h3>Day 13 (Jun 30) - Athens, Greece and Home</h3>

	  <p>Oh man, the cruise is over! We woke up this morning to rain. It was the first real rain we had for
	  the entire cruise. Our weather had been excellent. Anyway, we were docked in Pireaus, ready to
	  disembark and head to Athens airport. We had our final breakfast and said goodbye to all the folks we
	  had becomes friends with. Peter and Halcyon were doing the first leg to Heathrow with us, and were then 
	  transfering to London for an overnight stay and a visit with their daughter. We had a long layover waiting 
	  for our 1:30 flight to Frankfurt (on British Airways). The flight was about 4 hours long and we arrived in 
	  Heathrow ontime.
	  We said goodbye to P&H and found our way to the gate for our next leg to Calgary. This was a 9 hour 
	  flight and we arrived in Calgary about 8:00 PM. Chrissy and Matt were there to pick us up and
	  drive us home. They (and Minnie) were staying overnight with us as they were heading off to Nanaimo
	  the next day for a wedding, and we were looking after Minnie for them. Once again I got that strange feeling
	  where this morning we were in Athens (I saw the Olympiacos football stadium) and here I was in
	  Calgary now. Strange.</p>
	  <p>This was an absolutely amazing, wonderful cruise. Loved the ports, loved the people, loved the food,
	  loved the ship - what more could you ask? Glad to be home though, getting ready for our next cruise in 
	  two weeks.
