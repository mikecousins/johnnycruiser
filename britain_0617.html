    <p>This cruise diary continues from the<a href="britain_0617l.html"> 
      England / Wales land tour</a> that immediately preceded it. We had done 
      this same cruise (with one exception) several years ago - the only difference 
      being the swapping of Kirkwall for Liverpool. We had been twice to the Shetland 
      Islands, but never to the Orkneys, so Marjorie specially picked this cruise 
      for the new port. To save a bit of money we booked an oceanview cabin figuring 
      that the British Isles climate would prevent us from getting much use from 
      a balcony. As much as I love my balcony, it was the right decision as most 
      of the cruise was cold and windy on the ocean. 
    <p>The ship was very full. Almost all of the cabins were booked. Out of 3,100 passengers
	 about 2,000 of them were from the US, 400 from Britain and 200 from Canada. The
	 rest were from a multitude of countries. The ship had just come out of drydock and some
	 of the public areas had been renovated or changed. The service staff and room stewards 
	 were excellent and always willing to please.  The food was very good in the dining room 
	 and international cafe, but I was a bit disappointed with the buffet fare. I guess I'm 
	 spoiled by the Oceania buffet where meat is cooked to order right in front of you.
	 <p>Formal night is dying on Princess (yeah) just as it has on Celebrity (yeah!).
	 The only difference is that Celebrity has re-written their dress code policy
	 while Princess has just stopped enforcing it. Marjorie and I dressed as normal 
	 on "formal night" as did 50% of the other diners with no implications. Princess
	 should re-write / clarify what  they are willing to enforce or abandon formal
	 nights altogether (yeah!).
	 <p>We do enjoy playing trivia on a cruise and met a wonderful couple 
	 (Jim & Vickie) who joined us for the duration of the cruise. They were very sharp 
	 at trivia leaving Marjorie and I to fill in the odd gap. Our other two team mates (6
	 on a team) varied from session to session from a pool  of 4 or 5 sporadic
	 players. We were quite successful, often winning or tieing for the win.
	 Best of all, we had a lot of laughs.

      </center>

    The <a href="britain_0617l.html">previous land 
    cruise diary</a> left us at Gatwick Airport on our way to Southampton. We
	were dropped off at the departures level of the south terminal, and right across the street was
	the National Express bus depot. It was around an hour's wait  for our bus and we boarded
	about 10:30.  We had done the Heathrow to/from Southampton route (via Winchester) several
	times before, but the Gatwick bus took a different route hitting Portsmouth, Fareham, Southampton,
	Bournemouth and Poole. This was new country for us which was nice. Portsmouth had a lovely sea front.
	We arrived in Southampton about 1:30 and had a short walk to our hotel (Holiday Inn). We checked
	in and then headed across the street to Marks & Spencers for a late lunch/dinner. There was some new 
	construction since our last visit, including a new "Showcase Cinema De Lux". We wandered up High Street and
	had an ice cream cone.  We ended up at ASDA grocery store where we bought some muffins for
	tomorrow's breakfast. We decided to trial the hike from the hotel to our cruise ship. The
	ship was docked at the QE II docks, which we hadn't been to before. It was several 
	blocks to the main gate of the dock where we were blocked from going any further. That was OK,
	how much farther could it be? We returned to the hotel and went to bed.

      We were up by  6:30.  We munched down the muffins and then
	 wandered around the hotel area. Marks & Spencers opened at 10:30 AM, so we did some
	 shopping. By now it was really hot out. We checked out of the hotel and headed off to the ship 
	 dragging our bags behind us. It took about 15 minutes to get to the dock gate that we walked 
	 to last night. Today it was open, so we entered and started walking along the dock. There was
	 no shade along the way and it was far further than we had estimated. In all, it took us nearly
	 45 minutes to get to the ship. Phew!! We dropped off our bags, checked in and then headed 
	 to our cabin to dump our carryon stuff. Marjorie had alerted Princess of my birthday and the 
	 cabin door had a "Happy Brithday" poster and balloons. Thanks Marjie! We headed up
	 to the buffet for lunch. By the time we got back to our cabin, our bags had arrived. We unpacked 
	 and put stuff away. Muster drill was at 4:30, half an hour late due to late passenger arrivals.
	 For dinner I had a steak pie. It was very good. We skipped the entertainment, wandered, then 
	 headed to bed.

       <h3>Day 2 (Jun 19) - A day in Sark</h3>
      </center>

    <img src="images/diary_britain_0617/photo_britain_0617_08.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
    We woke up at 6:00 to a beautiful blue sky day. It was going to be very warm. 
    We had breakfast in the buffet as we anchored in St. Peterport, Guernsey, 
    and then headed off to our 7:00 shore tour. We had explored Guernsey on a 
    previous cruise, so decided to do something different this time. The tour 
    would take us by ferry to the small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sark">island 
    of Sark</a>. About 450 people live on the island with only bicycles and horses 
    for transportation as no cars, trucks or motorbikes are allowed there. (Actually 
    they do have a few tractors, but that's it). All of the roads are dirt roads, 
    but they are well maintained. Surprisingly, the island has a large school 
	and a parliament building. We tendered in to the St. P dock and then transferred 
    to the Sark ferry. There was a mix-up causing the ferry to be waiting at the wrong dock,
	so that took half an hour to clear up. The ferry ride was about an hour long, arriving
	at Sark about 9:00 AM. The island was rimmed 
    with rocky cliffs, so the village was entirely on a central plateau. We got 
    off the ferry at a small dock and were jostled up to the village on tractor 
    pulled wagons. In the village center we transferred to a number of horse drawn 
    carriages, each with a capacity of 10 passengers plus a driver. The quaint 
    village, the blue sky, the sound of the horses hooves - we were in heaven!

      There were only enough buggies for half of our crowd, so we were split into two groups - one  doing the
	  carriage ride first, then the garden / village tour; the other doing the carrige ride second. Our driver 
	  took us around quite a bit of the island (for about an hour) then dropped us off at the "La
	  Seigneurie Gardens" for an hour or so.  The gardens were beautiful including a soft fruit area, an 
	  orchard, a vegetable garden, a small hedge maze and, of course, a flower garden. We wandered 
	  the grounds for quite a while and then broke out the cookies and Coke (from the ship). The carriages 
	  returned to take us the short distance back to the town center. There we were given another hour to 
	  explore the village.  We discovered a general store and had ice cream cones to beat the heat.
	  It was about noon that the tractor appeared to take us back to the ferry dock. We had a one hour 
	  voyage back to St. P. Now, our stay in Guernsey was a short one and our ship was supposed to 
	  sail at 2:30. Therefore, all of the Guernsey tours were morning tours. By fluke, all of the Guernsey tours 
	  seemed to have arrived back at the tender port at the same time. There was a huge lineup of
	  people waiting for the tenders. We were in the line for almost an hour (in the hot sun) until we 
	  finally made it to a tender. Not nice! Regardless, we had certainly enjoyed our brief visit to Sark.
	  We were back on the ship by 2:30, and the ship had to delay leaving until 3:00. We had a late
	  lunch in the International cafe, and then made it to afternoon trivia where we tied for the win. For
	  dinner I had broiled shrimp with vegetable rice. Excellent. Once again we didn't make it to the 
	  entertainment but instead wandered and then went to bed.

      Today we were visiting the port town of Cobh (pronounced Cove). This was our third visit, 
	  so we didn't plan an excursion. The weather was mostly sunny and warm.
	  We were up at 6:30 and had breakfast in the MDR.  At around
	  9:30 we did a walk around the town ending up at the library so that Marjorie could use the
	  internet. The town is built on the slopes of  a hill, so some of the streets were quite steep.
	  On the way back to the ship we stopped at a small grocery store to buy a couple
	  of cans of Beamish stout. We were back onto the ship by 12:30. We had lunch at the
	  pizzaria (part of the buffet). Afterwards Marjorie headed back into town to the library while 
	  I went to the gym. At 4:30 trivia we did very well (won). For dinner I had roast beef and 
	  yorkshire pudding. At 8:00 we did evening trivia and tied for second. It was a very 
	  enjoyable day.

        The weather was changing. We woke up to cool and cloudy in Dublin.  In fact it was 
		raining in the early morning, but mostly dry for the rest of the day. We were excited to 
		be back in Dublin having been here several times in the past. We were up at 6:30
		and had breakfast in the buffet. We had booked an 8:45 tour out  of Dublin, mainly to
		the Powerscourt estate. We were out to the bus on time and did a quick tour of Dublin 
		in the heavy morning traffic. Then we headed south to the seaside village of Bray for
		a short pit stop. We wandered through the village, then got back on the bus. Our next
		stop was at Powerscourt Waterfall. We walked through a treed wilderness area to the
		highest waterfall in Ireland. We were given about half an hour to see the falls and 
		wander the park area. Being near lunch now we stopped at the Powerscourt Arms Hotel
		in the village of Eniskerry Town for a wonderful meal of Irish stew and apple dessert. 
		Our final stop was at the
		Powerscourt Estate and gardens where we toured through the stately home and then
		traipsed through the huge gardens surrounding the home. We were given 2 hours to
		explore the area. From there we drove back to the ship arriving about 5:00 PM - a full 
		day tour. The afternoon traffic in Dublin was just as bad as in the morning. For dinner
		I had leg of lamb. We wandered the decks for a while and then headed to bed.

      Today would be our third time in Belfast. In the past we had met up with our friend, Bill (from Larne)
	  but this time we were on our own. We hadn't booked any excursion and decided to just wander 
	  around the city. It was a cool day (high of 19), so it was long pants and a sweatshirt for me. We were
	  up at 7:30 and had breakfast in the MDR. Afterwards we hopped on the city shuttle bus to take us from
	  the container port to the city center (about 15 minutes). The shuttle was free as, like so many ports, we
	  were not allowed to walk through the busy container areas so the bus was provided. 
	  We wandered around the downtown core visiting
	  St. Ann's Cathedral, M&S, Lidl (groceries) and Dunnes (dept store). Marjorie bought some souvenirs
	  (tea towels and mug) while I got some Irish beer. We shuttled back to the ship in time for lunch (12:30).
	  After lunch Marjorie did laundry while I went to the gym. (Marjorie cleaning the clothes, me making them dirty!).
	  For dinner I had lamb shank. Then wandering and bed.

      Today we were returning to Greenock. The previous time we had done a local tour
	  around Greenock, followed by a tour of Loch Lomand. This time we were meeting  good
	  friends from a previous cruise - Ray and Ronald from Troon - who had kindly volunteered to
	  take us on a tour of Robbie Burns country. It was a cloudy, cool day, but not too bad.
	  We were up at 7:00 as we docked in Greenock.  We ate in the buffet and then  left
	  the ship to meet R&R at 9:00. They were parked right outside the cruise dock gates
	  and welcomed us to our Burns adventure. We drove about an hour south of Greenock to 
	  Alloway - Burns' birthplace. Our first stop of interest was the Robbie Burns Museum which 
	  was wonderful. We learned a lot of facts about his life and endeavors. From the museum
	  we walked to the old Burns house (birthplace) and gardens. A volunteer in period costume
	  explained each room and demonstrated some of the items on display. Afterwards we 
	  walked back to the old Alloway Kirk where Robbie's parents were buried and then
	  to the new Alloway Parish Church.

    It was about 12:15, so we walked across the street to the "Poet's Corner" 
    for lunch. We had a very nice lunch and then walked to the Burns garden at 
    the Brig o'Doon House. From there we wandered to the Brig o'Doon (yes, it's 
    a real bridge) and walked over it. The road had been relocated by half a kilometer, 
    so the Brig did not lead to anything other than a green copse and hill. While 
    we were standing on the bridge the sun popped out! That was nice. By now it 
    was 2:30 so R&R drove us back to the ship (arriving about 3:30). Thank you 
    R&R for a very interesting and educational day! After saying our goodbyes, 
    I headed onto the ship while Marjorie walked to a nearby grocery store for 
    some shopping. She was back aboard on time for a 4:30 folkloric show in the 
    theatre. It was very good - pipers, highland dancers and a singer. For dinner 
    I had seafood skewers. While we were eating, the captain announced that due 
    to some very heavy weather in the Orkneys, we would be scratching our port 
    stop at Kirkwall and adding an extra sea day. We would be arriving at Invergordon 
    in the afternoon of the second day. Aaargh! Kirkwall was the one new port 
    for us and why we had booked this sailing. Too bad! To bed. <br clear=left>

	  The two sea days (one and a half actually) went quickly. It was cold and rainy 
	  outside, so we stayed mostly inside the ship. We breakfasted and lunched in 
	  the MDR, often chatting after the meal. Marjorie attended presentations while 
	  I went to the gym. We had several trivias and fared quite well. The first night 
	  we decided to eat dinner in the buffet.
	  <p>On the second afternoon we docked at Invergordon. We were a day early, 
	  so there were no excursions. Invergordon is a small, "one street" town. You
	  can't get lost because you either walk down the street or up the street. So
	  3,000 of us passengers infiltrated the town of 4,000 people, flooding the
	  street with curious onlookers. The weather had warmed up, it was dry, 
	  and the sun even popped out for a while. The shops and houses were very quaint. A
	  number of the buildings had huge painted murals. We did enjoy our walk 
	  in town, but eventually headed back on board for trivia then dinner. For dinner 
	  I had prime rib. Evening trivia was "Animal Planet" and our team mates J&V 
	  were a fountain of knowledge re everything about the TV series. We (ahem!)
	  won with a 100% score. Bed time.

    As of today we were back on schedule again, waking up at  6:00 still in Invergordon. 
	We ate breakfast in the buffet as we had a 7:30 tour booked. Outside it was
	cloudy and cool. We were at the bus at the prescribed time and drove north 
	along the coast towards Dunrobin Castle. The driver delayed taking us 
	directly onto the main thoroughfare so that he could take us through the
	quaint village of Tain. We arrived at the castle a bit early, at 8:45.  They
	normally open at 10:00 but made special arrangements to let our group
	in at 9:00. So, we had to mill around in the parking lot for a bit until they opened.
	We were given two hours to take the self guided tour through the castle and
	then walk around the extensive gardens. On the way back 
	to the ship we stopped at
	the seaside town of Dornoch. It was a quaint little village and it treated us to 
	a bit of rain. We had half an hour to explore the village and then saddled up
	for the drive back to the ship. We arrived onboard by 1:00.  We had lunch
	at the International Cafe and then read, wandered and I went to the gym.
	Trivia was at 4:30, but I don't think we did too well. For dinner I had veal scallopini
	which was really nice. Afterwards there were three trivias in a row - space, 
	jeopardy (won) and 50's music.  All in all a great day. 
	<p><i><b>Note: </b>I thought we would ace the space trivia. After all, I took 
      up space at university. But when the first question asked the weight (sic!) 
      of the Hubble telescope in elephants, I knew I was doomed. Besides, everyone 
      knows that the Hubble scope is currently weightless (zero elephants). I 
      didn't have the nerve to explain to the moderator the difference between 
      weight and mass.</i>

      <h3>Day 10 (June 27) - Anchored at South Queensferry (Edinburgh)</h3>
      </center>
      
    <img src="images/diary_britain_0617/photo_britain_0617_72.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
    <img src="images/diary_britain_0617/photo_britain_0617_74.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
    This morning we were up at 7:30 to watch us anchor off of South Queensferry, 
    in view of the Firth of Forth bridges. It was stormy outside - 11 degrees, 
    raining and very windy. As the ship anchored, the wind came up causing the ship 
    to drag the anchor. Not good! So, the captain had to raise the anchor and 
    reset it, which took about an hour. All of the morning tours were delayed 
    but ours was, by fluke, an afternoon tour. As we had lots of time, we breakfasted 
    in the MDR. We played morning trivia (very sparsely populated) and won. We 
    had an early lunch and then headed off on our 12:30 tour. We tendered to the 
    shore area, climbed in the bus and drove off on our adventure. We drove north 
    along the highway and, near the village of Falkirk, went past "The Kelpies" 
    - two 30 meter high horse head sculptures. Pretty impressive. Our first stop 
    was at the <a href="http://battleofbannockburn.com/">Bannockburn museum</a>. 
    There was a huge battle there between the English and the Scots. The Scots 
    won, hence the museum to commemorate it. The displays were mostly 360 surround 
    3-D movies putting you right into the historic battle. There was also a huge 
    war room map on which you could electronically play out different scenarios 
    of the battle (the Scots always win). Outside of the museum was a monument 
    to Robert the Bruce.

     After spending about an hour in the Bannockburn museum, we reboarded the bus and drove further 
	 north to Stirling Castle. We were given a brief historical lecture about the castle and
	 then were allowed 2 hours to roam the castle and grounds. The castle is actually 
	 many buildings, built over the years. Some
	 of the buildings house interesting museums now. Others have been restored  with
	 furnishings from the various eras. The grand hall was beautifully restored  with
	 colorful coats of arms on the ceiling and decorative flags. The indoor displays
	 were extra welcome as it was drizzling with rain outside. After exhausting our time 
	 allotment, we boarded the bus for our return drive to the ship.
    <p><i><b>Note:</b> As we approached South Queensferry the guide pointed out 
      a shipyard (across the forth) where two aircraft carriers were under construction 
      for the British navy. One of them was supposed to start sea trials today. 
      Sure enough, later in the evening, we saw one of the carriers with a tug 
      escort heading across the forth.</i> 
    <p>We arrived at the ship about 6:30. Because of the late tours, the MDR was 
	open seating. For dinner I had diver scallops. We missed
	trivia due to our late dinner. As we went to bed we turned the clocks one hour 
	forward, ready for a day in France.

      Today was our final sea day as we headed across the North Sea towards Le Havre
	  in France. It was still very cool, wet and windy. We had breakfast in the MDR followed
	  by morning trivia, where we came second.  After a wander around the ship we did a 
	  lecture on the history of Europe since the Roman times. We decided to eat lunch in the 
	  buffet. Afterwards Marjorie wandered or did a shop sale while I went to the gym. Trivia 
	  was at 4:00 and we repeated our second place performance. For dinner I had shrimp
	  and scallops (love seafood). Then there were two evening trivias - rock and roll, and
	  movie themes. Not my forte, but then we had J&V on our team to pull us through.

      We were up at 7:00 to watch us pull into the city of Le Havre. The last time we were here 
	  we had done an all day trip into Paris (3 hours each way). This time we had decided
	  to tour the city of Rouen, just over an hour away. We were booked on the afternoon 
	  tour (1:30 to 7:00) so didn't have to hurry in the morning. It was cloudy and cool out, but 
	  not raining. We had a leisurely breakfast in the MDR. We did morning trivia at 10:30.
	   Afterwards we made a start at  packing our bags as disembarkation was tomorrow.
	   We had a buffet lunch  and then packed our backpack for the tour. The bus  left about 
	   1:30 and we drove east along the Seine to Rouen. We were let off by the old town and 
	   did a walking tour on the cobbled streets. Our route took us by the old clock tower and
	   the law courts. We ended up at the modern Joan of Arc Church which we toured through.
	   About a block away we saw where Joan of Arc had been burned at the stake by the 
	   English. Not a nice ending!

	   At this point it was about 3:30 and we were set loose for a 2 hour on-your-own time
	   wander through the shopping district.
      We explored along the main street and ended up at the Notre Dame Cathedral.
	  The cathedral was open so we did a walk through the huge  building. The stained
	  glass windows were amazing. When we finally exited the church, the sun popped out
	  and a small brass band was assembling in the facing square. We popped into a nearby 
	  info center so that Marjorie could use the internet. Then we wandered back to our starting 
	  point arriving maybe 20 minutes early, which we spent browsing in an adjacent farmer's
	  market. There were lots of flowers, veggies, meats and sea food. We piled on the bus 
	  just as it started to pour in rain. By good fortune we hadn't faced a single drop of rain while 
	  we were out and about. We were back to the ship by 7:00. The restaurant
	  was open seating again due to the late excursions. For dinner I had lamb shank. We
	  returned to our cabin to
	  finish packing our suitcases. We put our suitcases out in the hallway and hustled to 
	  the Explorer's Lounge for a final trivia. We said our goodbyes to our trivia mates and
	  headed off to bed. We put the clocks an hour back tonight.

      <h3>Day 13 (Jun 30) - Southampton and home</h3>

     We were up early on our final day. We were docked at the Mayflower docks in 
	 Southampton. We breakfasted in the buffet then hustled to meet our 8:15 check-out time. 
	 We left the ship and located our bags in the terminal building. From there we
	 went out to the bus that would take us to Heathrow. It was about a 2.5 hour drive
	 and we were dropped off at Terminal 2. We went through security and had time 
	 to snack on some cookies and peanuts in the general seating area.  Our flight 
	 was direct to Calgary, leaving at 1:00.  The incoming flight was late, so we were 
	 about 1 hour late leaving LHR. We arrived in Calgary about 4:00. Customs  was
	 pretty quick as it is fairly automated now. Christina was waiting for us at the baggage 
	 area. She transported us back to her house where we transferred to our own car
	 and drove home. We were home by 6:00 PM. The kitties were delighted to see us.
	 The house was fine. Another great cruise!
