      <p>Having done four 7 day cruises, we decided it was time for a 14 day cruise. We couldn't find a 14 day 
	  Caribbean cruise that we liked, so decided to do back-to-back 7 day cruises. Some ships do alternating 7 day itineraries
	  just for this event , but we thought it would be nice to try 2 different ships. So we settled on the eastern 
	  Caribbean on the Century (Sat - Sat),  followed by the western Caribbean on the Grand Princess (Sun - Sun). 
	  Due to the cruises being out of sync by 1 day, we spent one night hoteling it between cruises. This page
	  reviews the Century sailing.

        <h3>Pre-Cruise (Nov 28) - Travelling to Ft Lauderdale</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_00.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>As has become our custom, we flew down to Ft Lauderdale the day before the cruise. No sense
	  being late for the departure. This gives us an opportunity to do a little shopping and to enjoy the 
	  warm Florida weather.  The weather this time was not the greatest, and Florida was posting
	  some record lows for the season.</p>
	  <p>The flight down was good, but the airports were very crowded. Once again we were
	  travelling on the US Thanksgiving holiday. Why don't we learn!
	  <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 1 (Nov 29) - Boarding in Ft Lauderdale</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_01.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>The next morning, we took the hotel shuttle to the airport. We had booked 
        the Celebrity transfer from the airport to the ship. It's really handy 
        as they pick up your luggage at the airport and deliver it to your cabin 
        on the ship. For some unknown reason, Celebrity wouldn't let us book the 
        transfer unless we were landing that same day. So I looked up a flight 
        from Toronto on the Web and gave them that flight number. When we checked 
        in to the Celebrity area at the airport, the girl asked me our flight 
        number, so I said "<i>We're on flight number AC920 from Toronto and we 
        land in ten minutes.</i>". I couldn't resist that!
		<p>The embarkation proceeded quite quickly, so we headed to our 
		room to drop off our stuff, then on to the buffet for lunch. After lunch we checked
		out the ship and did the life boat thingy. We watched some of the
		other cruise ships leave Port Everglades, then it was our turn and we headed
		out  into the open ocean.

      <center>
        <h3>Day 2 (Nov 30) - A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_02.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>The Century is very similar to the Mercury in both size and age.  There
	  are very few balconies. We booked an aft "family" oceanview cabin.  The 
	  cabin was quite large with a sliding, panelled divider between the bedroom
	  and the sitting area. The view was directly behind the ship, right in the center.
	  <p>We spent the sea day relaxing and checking out the ship. 
	  The ship was finished with a lot of marble and beautiful woodwork.  And, being
	  the season, there were Christmas trees and decorations throughout the ship.
	  <p>The seas were really rough. Marj was a little under the weather, so I went
	  alone to dinner. The dining room was half empty as a lot of the passengers
	  were feeling the effects of the rolling ship.
      <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 3 (Dec 1) - San Juan, Puerto Rico</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_03.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>We were scheduled to arrive in San Juan about 4:30 PM, but due
	  to the rough seas, we didn't arrive until after 5:30. Because it was almost dinner 
	  time and we had done 2 days in San Juan before, we decided to stay on the ship
	  for the evening.</p>
	  <p>There were several cruise ships in town, including the 4 masted <i>Club 
        Med 2</i> ship. We didn't leave San Juan until after midnight, so, needless to say, we missed the sail away!
    <p>The fitness center on the Century is unusual in that they have co-located the real fitness equipment
	 (bikes, treadmills, rowing machine, etc) with the "fake" fitness equipment ("fat pod", etc). For some
	 reason, they put the rowing machine (the noisest of all fitness equipment) right next to the fat pod. While
	 I was doing my rowing workout, the fitness instructor asked if I could stop rowing because a lady was
	 trying to sleep in the fat pod. I suggested that the lady could sleep in her cabin (without paying 
	 $60 per half hour) and kept on rowing. The staff never interrupted my rowing again, probably
	 because the fat pod was not very well used.
	 <br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 4 (Dec 2) - Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_04.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>We arrived in St. Thomas early in the morning. We had booked a kayaking / snorkelling
	  excursion and were picked up at the ship. We bused around the southern shore of the island to a 
	  bay with a large mangrove  forest. We kayaked through the mangrove lagoon seeing lots of interesting 
	  wildlife - birds, lizards, iguana, etc. We stopped at  the edge of the lagoon and did some snorkelling. 
	  The water was very shallow (about 2 to 3 feet) due to an abnormally low tide, and the fish were 
	  very small, but it was interesting.</p>
	  <p>In the afternoon, we browsed through the shopping area by the cruise ship dock. Lots of
	  jewelry shops and souvenir shops.
        <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 5 (Dec 3) - Philipsburg, St. Maarten</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_05.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
 	  <p>This was our first time to St. Maarten.  We arrived soon after sunrise and
	  headed off for our snorkelling excursion. We were bused across the island, from 
	  Philipsburg on the Dutch side, to Cul de Sac on the French side. From there, we took a small
	  boat across to Pinel Island.The snorkeling there was interesting, but not great. It was
	  a beautiful sunny day, so we didn't mind it at all.</p>
	  <p>We headed back to the ship for lunch and then walked along the beach and front street after lunch.
	  There seemed to be a lot of new construction going on along the beach front. The town
	  was very busy with people, especially along the street with all the jewelry and souvenir shops.
		<br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 6 (Dec 4) - Another Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_06.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	 <p>Another wonderful day at sea. The sea was a bit bumpy, so another light 
	 day in the dining room. There were lots of quite places on the ship, everyone
	 was up at the pool.</p>
	  <p>Another Celebrity first is the introduction of a sushi restaurant . It is set up
	  in a section of the buffet area every evening from 6 PM to 10 PM. It never
	  seemed very busy, but the sushi was excellent. We never ate dinner there, but
	  often popped in for that final bite after dinner.
	  <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 7 (Dec 5) - Nassau, The Bahamas</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_07.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>Our stop at Nassau was from 1:30 PM to 7:00 PM. I've noticed that
	  all ships seem to stop here for just half a day. I wonder if that's so they 
	  can squeeze more ships in per day. We got off the ship and headed 
	  into town. It was very cloudy, and when we hit town it poured in rain for about 1/2 an hour.
	  We got soaked while looking for a shop to hide in.</p>
	  <p>When the rain let up, he went back to the ship. Being to late to do an excursion, 
	  we stayed on the ship for the rest of the day.
	  <br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 8 (Dec 6) - Ft Lauderdale</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1103/photo_carib_1103_08.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>Wow, a whole week gone already! Disembarking went fine and we 
	  headed off to check in to our hotel, and to meet Joan and Dave who were joining us
	  for the second week of cruising on the Grand Princess. This gave us another
	  chance to do a bit of shopping, and to do some laundry ready for week 2.</p>
	  <p>The previous day I started coming down with a cold. It hit me hard, but only
	  lasted through the weekend, so I was fine for the next cruise.
	  <p>In summary, I gave the ship 4* (out of 5) as it does not have affordable balconies.
	  I also gave 4* for service because our cabin steward did a poor job of cleaning the
	  cabin. Marj wrote a note to Celebrity after we returned home, and they sent us a $100 room
	  credit for a future cruise. It pays to complain!!
