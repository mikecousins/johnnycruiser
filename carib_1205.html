      <p>The Star Princess is identical to the Grand Princess. We had really enjoyed the Grand
	  two years ago, so decided to give the Star a try. Yes, this is the same ship that had the terrible 
	  fire that destroyed a hundred or so cabins just a couple of months later. I'm glad that we
	  missed that event. We were also sailing just a few weeks after the worst hurricane season
	  in recent history. We wondered what shape the Caribbean was going to be in.</p>
	  <p>Our trip started with a mixed blessing, even before we left Calgary. We were looking at our
	  air itinerary to let our son know when to pick us up from the airport when we returned from the 
	  cruise on Dec 11. The return leg was dated Dec 12!! The person that took the reservation 
	  had entered the wrong return date. We called the airline, but they wouldn't budge and we 
	  would have had to rebook the flight at a ridiculous rate. There's a lot worse things than 
	  discovering you have to spend an extra day in paradise, so we booked a hotel for the extra night. 
      <br>

        <h3>Day 1 (Dec 3/4) - Boarding in Ft Lauderdale</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_01.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>We arrived in Ft Lauderdale only a few weeks after it was devestated by a hurricane.
	  Once again we arrived a day early, just to ensure we made the ship OK. As we flew over
	   the city, we could see a lot of damage - especially roofs. Lot's of work for roofers!</p>
	   <p>When we arrived in Ft Lauderdake (at the airport), we phoned B/W to be picked up
	  by their shuttle. They had no record of our booking and it turned out that
	  they had cancelled our reservation for unknown reasons. They were full up. 
	  So, we tried every hotel on the call board - same answer, full up. The final
	  one we tried was the Red Carpet Inn, and they had 2 vacancies. We hustled
	  over and got a room. BUT ... the hotel was the worst we have ever seen. 
	  It catered to biker gangs and hookers. The rooms were filthy and everything
	  was damaged and falling apart. It was absolutely gross. The next morning 
	  we stood in line for the cruise dock shuttle with a number of other cruisers that had
	  booked the hotel through the Web. They were all in shock. The Web had made 
	  the hotel sound very nice. One couple
	  turned out to have a cabin near ours on the ship and we were always bumping into
	  one another. We would jokingly compare our cabins to the rooms at the Red Carpet.</p>
	  <p><font color="darkgreen">Update (March, 2007) - Virtual Tourist had a "Top 10" list
	  of the 10 filthiest hotels in America. The Red Carpet Inn was #5 on the list. I'd hate to see the
	  4 hotels that beat it!!</font></p>
	   <p>The next morning, we headed off to the ship. The embarkation process
	   went pretty well. We dumped our stuff off in our  cabin, and then headed to the buffet for lunch.
	   Having been on the Grand Princess previously, we had no problem finding our way 
	   around the Star.</p>
	   <p>After checking out the ship, we attended the lifeboat drill. Then it was dinner time. As
	   usual, we had booked Personal Choice dining, as we really enjoy being able to
	   eat when we want, and to meet  new people each evening.

        <h3>Day 2 (Dec 5) - A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_02.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>Our second day was a day at sea. It was a beautiful sunny day, and the  ocean
	  was calm. You would never know  that only a few months earlier, such deadly storms
	  were raging. We spent the day relaxing and walking around the ship.</p>
	  <p>One drawback to Princess is that they don't have any rowing machines in
	  their gyms. I'm a rower (indoor), and HAL, RCCL and Celebrity have one or two ergs
	  on each of their ships. But not Princess. I mentioned this to the gym attendent,
	  and he said that "not a single ship afloat had a rowing machine"! Hmmm, I wonder
	  what lines he has cruised?</p>
	  <p>Formal night tonight. Marj and I don't care for formal night, but we tolerate it and 
	  go along with it. It will be so nice when cruise ships smarten up and we no longer 
	  require an extra suitcase for show-off night! (Oops, enough of that).
      <br clear=left>

        <h3>Day 3 (Dec 6) - Cozumel, Mexico</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_03.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>We arrived at Cozumel just after sunrise. We had been to Cozumel twice before, 
	  and were anxious to see how it had fared with Wilma. It was a disaster. All three of the 
	  piers were gone, so we had to tender in. On shore, workers were busy cleaning up 
	  and rebuilding. We had booked a snorkel excursion, so grabbed a taxi to the La Coleta
	  marina. With the reduction in cruise ship traffic and land hotels, there were only
	  four of us on the boat. As we headed out of the marina, we saw a lot of boats that
	  were damaged or sunken from the storm. What a mess!</p>
	  <p>As we headed south down the Cozumel coast, we passed Chaukanaab Park
	  where we had snorkelled a couple of years earlier. The sand and beach were totally gone.
	  The botanical gardens were just twisted sticks, and the dolphin encounter area was
	  nowhere to be seen. It will take a long time for this park to recover again. </p>
	  <p>The snorkelling was pretty good, but there was a lot of coral damage due to 
	  the storm. Poor Cozumel!
		<br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 4 (Dec 7) - George Town, Grand Cayman</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_04.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>We arrived in GeorgeTown around noon. This is a tendering site, so we didn't 
	  expect to get ashore too early. Because we had done the Seven Mile Beach and 
	  Stingay City on two previous vists, we decided just to stay in town and snorkel at 
	  Eden Rock. It is only a 10 minute walk from the tender slip, and the snorkelling is 
	  quite good. We snorkelled for a while and then warmed up on the beach. It was 
	  a great way to spend an afternoon.</p>
	  <p>There were four large ships in harbour, so the town was quite crowded. We
	  didn't bother walking around with the crowds, but just headed back to the ship for 
	  dinner. We didn't notice any storm damage in the area. I think that Grand Cayman 
	  was spared from anything major.
	   <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 5 (Dec 8) - Ocho Rios, Jamaica</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_05.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
 	  <p>We got up early to watch the ship dock in Ocho Rios. It was dark and stormy, 
	  and the ship was tossing around. The ship made several attempts to approach 
	  the dock, but it was just too windy. The captain announced that the ship would 
	  head back out and try for Montego Bay. The last time we were in Ocho Rios, we 
	  didn't care for it at all, so this was no big loss to us.</p>
	  <p>We docked at Montego Bay around 1:00 PM under cloudy skies and sporadic rain. Because
	  this was a last minute port, we had no excursion booked. There is nothing
	  around the dock area, so we went out for a quick walk and then headed back
	  to the ship to relax, read and do a gym workout. So much for Jamaica! Not our
	  favorite island.
		<br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 6 (Dec 9) - Another Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_06.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	 <p>The next day was back to sunshine and blue skies.  It was
	 a day at sea, so we had all day to relax, read, walk the ship, etc. 
	 It's funny, but when we have a sea day, I often feel that I like sea
	 days the best. However, when we spend a day in port, I usually feel l
	 like the port days best. I guess I like them both!</p>
	 <p>I had recently watched a show on the Discovery Channel about unusual 
	 ships. One of the ships featured was a pleasure yacht transport ship. The entire
	 mid section of the ship could be lowered below sea level so that the yachts could be
	 floated on or off the ship. It was fascinating. Well, I was looking out to sea that day,
	 and, behold, there it was! Even though it was quite distant, I immediately knew that 
	 it was the ship I had seen on Discovery, and it was loaded with brand new yachts.
	 Thank goodness for the telephoto lens to record the sighting. Miles and miles
	 of ocean, and there it was! What kind of coincidence was that?
	  <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 7 (Dec 10) - Princess Cays</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_07.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>Our penultimate day was spent at Princess Cays. It was beautiful there.
	  Next to Half Moon Cay, it's my favorite beach. We spent the morning
	  snorkelling and sitting on the beach. We skipped the beach barbeque and
	  headed back aboard the ship for the sit down lunch. It sure is quiet when
	  most of the passengers are ashore.</p>
	  <p>We left Princess Cays early - about 3:00 PM. Instead of heading NW
	  towards Ft Lauderdale, we headed eastward around the far side of 
	  Eluthera Island. This took us within sighting distance of Half Moon Cay, where
	  we crossed paths with the Westerdam heading away from Half Moon Cay.
	  Then, in the distance, we spotted a spray of water coming from a large black 
	  hump in the water. It was a whale. About every 30 seconds it would send 
	  another plume of water into the air. The whale must have been floating as the black
	  hump was always visible. We watched it for quite a while until
	  we left it in the distance. Too bad we weren't closer.
	  <br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 8 (Dec 11) - Ft Lauderdale</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_carib_1205/photo_carib_1205_08.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>We arrived in Port Everglades before sunrise. Our flight wasn't until the next day,
	   so we booked a Ft Lauderdale tour through the ship. The
	  disembarkation process went well and we were soon on the tour bus. We stopped
	  at the River Harbour for a walk around, and then toured through the downtown area.
	  We ended up at a dock where we boarded a riverboat for a tour of the harbour.
	  We sailed by many multi-million dollar homes on the water which were just beautiful.
	  How are there so many people that can afford these homes? Then we sailed
	  in to the Port Everglades harbour and looked up at the huge cruise ships docked 
	  there (including the Star). It was a great finish to the cruise week.</p>
	  <p>After the boat tour, we got back on the bus and were delivered to the airport.
	  From there, we caught the shuttle to La Quinta Suites (not the Red Carpet Inn!!).
	  Tomorrow we would fly home after another great cruise. The ship was wonderful - full marks
	  for the Star Princess. The itinerary wasn't up to par as Cozumel was trashed and 
	  Jamaica was a disappointment.
