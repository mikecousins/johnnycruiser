      <p>We booked the Harmony OTS a long time ago as a placeholder 
	  for a really cheap deposit. It was our plan to convert it into another cruise sometime in the future.
	  Fortunately our family (Dave and Joan, and Lynn) were impressed
	  and jumped aboard to join us on the Harmony.
	  We rethought the cruise and realized that we would enjoy the ship immensely
	  and were soon looking forward to it. And, of course, it was a chance to visit 
	  with Marjorie's relatives too! Somewhere along the way Barry (Dave's brother)
	  joined us too - the more the merrier!
	  <p> The ship was awesome with so much to do for adults and for kids.
	  The entertainment has to tbe among the best at sea - with a 90 minute 
	  "Grease" production in the main theater and two different water shows 
	  at the Aqua Theater topping the bill. Other productions of song and dance,
	  a ventriloquist and ice shows were excellent as well. The only complaint I 
	  had overall was with the itinerary (same old, same old) but you don't do this
	  cruise for the itinerary, it's the ship and the sunshine that really count!
	  <p>The ship was full, with 5,877 passengers (double occupancy is 5,400).
	  However, there is a ton of public space, so it didn't seem overly crowded.
	  One place that was crowded was the Windjammer buffet, so we had most 
	  of our meals in other venues (MDR, Park cafe, Solarium, etc). Our Elite status gave
	  Marjorie and me 3 drinks each at dinner time, so we spread those around 
	  our dinner table each night. Similar to what we have found on Celebrity, RCI has relaxed 
	  their dress code, replacing "formal" with "evening chique" which only
	  suggests jacket and tie, but allows regular casual wear too. One
	  "first" we noticed was several hand sinks at the entrance to the buffet
	  Hand sanitizers are no longer enough.
    <p>We found that there was so much to do each day that I didn't go to the 
      gym even once. I don't think I suffered for it, though, and made up for 
      it on the following B2B cruise. Yes, I should quickly mention that a seven 
      day cruise just wasn't enough, so we booked a subsequent B2B cruise on the 
      Carnival Splendor. That's covered in a 
	  <a href="carib_1216b.html">
	  separate diary</a>. 
	  Another (Caribbean) first was that we didn't attempt to snorkel at any of the ports
	  along the way. This was just an "enjoy the ship" and sunshine cruise.

      <p>We left home just after 6:30 AM in traffic, and arrived at Chrissy's
	  about 7:30. We picked up Chrissy and drove to the airport, arriving about 8:00.
	 After letting us off, she drove our car back home and stabled it for two weeks.
	 Our check-in and transit through security went fairly quickly. I ran into Shafique, 
	 an old Nortel buddy, in the security lineup. Hadn't seen him in 12 years! 
	 What a nice surprise! Also
	 met D&J in the waiting room, connecting from Victoria. Our flight to Toronto
	 (10:00 AM) was ontime and we arrived in TO about 3:45. We had to repeat 
	 security and then do US customs pre-clearance. Somewhere along the way
	 we met Barry (connecting from Edmonton). We were all together except Lynn.
	 Our connection time was tight as we arrived at the gate just as the
	 5:00 flight (to Fort Lauderdale) was boarding. We arrived in FLL about 8:30 
	 and Lynn (connecting from Vancouver) was waiting for us at the baggage
	 claim. We all caught the hotel shuttle to the Fairfield Inn in Dania. It was a lovely
	 27 degrees. We wandered around the hotel grounds and then headed to bed.

    <p>We woke up late (8:00 AM) and did the free breakfast  at the hotel. Then
	Marj and I, and Barry and Lynn walked about a mile down the road to
	Publix. We got some Pepsi and snacks for the cruise.  It was the
	same distance back to the hotel where we checked out and waited for the
	11:45 cruise dock shuttle. It was only about 10 minutes to Port Everglades 
	where we checked in and made our way to the ship. We were in our cabin 
	by 1:00 PM, just as the cabins were opened. We dropped off our carry-ons
	and headed to the Park Cafe for lunch. We returned to our cabin and our 
	bags had been delivered. We unpacked and put everything away. Then 
	it was time for our 4:15 muster drill. Once again I learned how to don a life
	jacket, much more complicated than an airplane seat belt. Sail away
	was at  5:00 and we watched it from a small deck area at the front of the ship.
	Our dining was "anytime" and we weren't able to get a table for 6 before the
	cruise. We showed up and begged for a 6:15 table for 6 and the maitre d'
	made it so for the duration of the voyage. Woohoo! For dinner I had shrimp
	linguini. It was delicious. The entertainment was 2 stand-up comics. One 
	was OK, the other was excellent. We wandered a bit and then went to bed.

      <p>We woke up at 7:30 and headed to the buffet for breakfast.  We spent a 
	  chunk of the morning just wandering around the huge ship. We weren't lost, just
	  misplaced. We met for 10:00 trivia - the first of many - and we won (or tied for the win).
	  Nice way to start! We did our favorite lunch in the MDR with the huge salad bar.
	  Afterwards it was more wandering around.  At 3:00 we met again for the start of
	  a three day (sea days) progressive trivia. At 4:00 there was a Harry Potter trivia 
	  where, for some reason, I was the only one of our group to show up. I didn't fare
	  too well. At 5:00 everyone reappeared for general trivia which we won. Dinner was
	  at 6:15 at our table for 6. I had beef tenderloin. Yum. It was formal night. I wore a
	  sweater and tie, but lots didn't dress up, so that was my only "tied" appearance.
	  We decided to try getting into the 9:00 water show (Fine Line) without reserved tickets, 
	  and were let in early for great seats! The swimming and diving was excellent.
	  Loved it. Then it was a quick wander and to bed.

    <p>We were up at 7:00 as we docked in Labadee, Haiti. The last time we were 
	here there was no dock and we had to tender in. Having the new dock was very 
	convenient. We had no fixed plans for the port, so we didn't have to rush. We had
	breakfast in the MDRand then wandered the ship until trivia time at 10:00. (we tied
	for the win). Then we left the ship to explore the onshore cruise arcade and private 
	beach. It was quite hot so we didn't stay out too long. We were back on the ship
	at 12:30, in time for lunch at the Park Cafe. We chatted with Lynn back at our cabin 
	and then went to 3:00 trivia - 50 logos. We got 30 of them, but the winners had 49.
	We stayed on for 4:00 trivia (bombed) and then met at 5:00 for photos with Alex 
	the Lion. For dinner I had rack of lamb. Afterwards we went to Grease (no 
	reservations) and got pretty good seats. It was a great show (1.5 hours). A
	quick wander and then to bed.

     <p>In the past we had never enjoyed Jamaica, with its agressive sales people
	 and drug problems. We had done Ocho Rios and Montego Bay several times, 
	 but this was our first time to Falmouth. This new port was created especiallly for
	 the RCI beheamoths, and is quite a distance from any town. Instead it is a
	 cruise ship mall in the jungle. We were up about 8:00 and had breakfast in the Park Cafe
	 with Lynn. She was off on an excursion.  Marjorie and I met Barry for 10:00 AM trivia and 
	 then headed off the ship to do the mall. We found some free wireless, so connected 
	 with the kids back home. We were back aboard in time for lunch. We read for a while 
	 then wandered the ship. At 4:00 we tried the cartoon trivia (did OK). The 5:00 general 
	 trivia was posted in the wrong location in the daily paper, so we missed it. We did 
	 get to sit in a new (to us) bar though. For dinner I had Thai chicken. Very good. We
	 were going to an ice skating show (iSkate), but the ice making machine was broken.
	 Instead we wandered the ship, read for a while then went to bed.

	We decided to try the solarium restaurant
	for breakfast and it was really nice. It was very quiet and had all we wanted for 
	selection. That influenced our choice of breakfast for the rest of the cruise.
	After breakfast we wandered around and then went to 10:00 AM "Holiday" trivia. 
	It was Christmas related and we did OK.
	Being a sea day, we did the salad bar lunch in the MDR - our favorite. 
	Love those salads! Afterwards
	we played 6 handed Hand & Foot in Dazzles. It is actually a bar, but had nice 
	seating and tables, and was deserted for the early afternoon. 
	We only got half way through the 
	game when it was time for 3:00 progressive trivia. We came second (again) 
	which was great for our progressive total. At 5:00 PM  there was another trivia. 
	Once again we  did OK
	<p>
	Tonight was formal night in the MDR so I had lobster for dinner. At 7:30 there was a 
	special non-reserved aqua show so we hustled through dinner and got some 
	excellent seats for the show. I enjoyed the show even more than the previous aqua 
	show - a kind of keystone kops adventure. We actually had to leave the aqua 
	show before it finished and run to the other end of the ship to the main theatre for 
	a ventriloquist show at 8:30 which we had reserved. It was excellent. 
	Then we had to run to the promenade area 
	to have our photos taken with Puss-N-Boots. Then to bed. It was an interesting evening.

    <p>Today we woke up at 7:00 as we come into the dock at Cozumel. This was 
      our 7th time to Cozumel, and we would be here again in 4 days, so we had 
      nothing planned for the day. We repeated our leisurely breakfast in the 
      Solarium and then wandered to 10:00 trivia. There was a pretty loyal trivia 
      group, even on port days.We wandered around the ship for a bit and then 
	  headed ashore to the cruise mall (with Lynn)  to look for vanilla for the kids.
	  All of the shops seemed to carry various local brands of vanilla so it
	  came down to finding a good price. Marjorie found some that she was happy with.
	  Then it was back on board for lunch in the buffet. We explored some more 
	  of the ship and then spent the rest of the afternoon reading on the promenade 
	  deck. We attended 5:00 trivia and won. For dinner I had prime rib. After dinner 
	  we went to an ice show which was very good. It's amazing the speed the 
	  performers attain in such a small ice rink. Then another wander and to bed.

      <p>We were up at 7:00 for our final day at sea. Once again we did breakfast 
	  in the Solarium. Afterwards we wandered until 10:00 trivia.  Marjorie slipped 
	  off to a t-shirt sale, also at 10:00. At 11:00 we went to the aqua theatre for a 
	  talk with the captain and his direct reports. It was interesting, but some of 
	  the stuff was rather silly. We left a bit early and headed to the MDR for my 
	  favorite salad bar lunch. Once again it was a read and wander afternoon, 
	  with a 3:00 trivia thrown in. At 5:00 we had our final progressive trivia and 
	  once again we did well. When the final scores were totaled up we ended 
	  up in second place overall for the three sea days. Not bad! For dinner I had 
	  braised short ribs, one of my favorites. We took the opportunity to say
	  goodbye to the others as tomorrow we would be going our separate 
	  ways. Then it was back to the cabin to
	  pack our suitcases and get them out to the hallway. We read for a while 
	  and then went to bed.

    <p>We were already docked in Fort Lauderdale when we arose at 7:00. D&J, Lynn 
      and Barry were leaving us for a stay in Florida, while Marjorie and I were 
      heading to Miami to catch another ship. We went to breakfast in the MDR 
      about 7:30 and took our time as we didn't need to exit the ship until 9:45. 
      It was pouring with rain today, so we just sat in our cabin and read. We 
      decided to leave a bit early so abandoned ship about 9:30. We located our 
      bags in the terminal building and went through customs. It was still cool 
      and cloudy out but we didn't get too wet. Marjorie borrowed someone's phone 
      and called KSA for our shuttle. We were supposed to be going directly to 
      the Port of Miami and our second ship. However, when we were finally picked 
      up the driver informed us that there was an accident in the tunnel leading 
      into the Port of Miami so we would be going to a local Fort Lauderdale hotel 
      instead to await an "all clear" signal. We arrived at the hotel about 10:30 
      and finally resumed our travel at 12:30. We arrived at our ship (the Carnival 
      Splendor) at 1:00 ready for our next adventure. You can read about it by
