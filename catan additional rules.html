	  <p><b><font color="#3300FF" size="4">5. Additional House Rules</font></b></p>
	  <p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">a) Special House Rules</font></b></p>
	  <p><ul>
	  <li>Citadel (see 
	  <a href="catan%20citadel%20rules.html" target=_blank>separate rules</a>
	  governing the citadel).
	  <li>Resource Tokens (see 
	  <a href="catan%20token%20rules.html" target=_blank>separate rules</a>
	  governing the resource tokens).
	  <li>Cities & Knights: Because the robber cannot attack before the first barbarian attack, 
	  rolls of "7" early in the game may advance the barbarians without providing any resource 
	  production. Therefore, when a "7" is rolled, it is ignored and the player rerolls the dice 
	  until something other than "7" is rolled. This means that the 7 card rule is void, but early 
	  in the game such a large number of cards is unusual. Once the barbarians have attacked, 
	  then rolls of "7" are treated normally.
	  <li>Cities & Knights: The two "Intrigue" cards are essentially useless. They should be 
	  removed from the game.
	  <li>When using the regular production number tokens, players tend to put settlements 
	  on high probability hexes (5, 6, 8, 9) and shun the improbable hexes (2, 3, 11, 12). What 
	  this does is to create large payouts when a 5, 6, 8 or 9 is rolled, and small payouts 
	  when a 2, 3, 11 or 12 is rolled. We have created some "multi-number" combo tokens 
	  to counteract this effect. The new tokens are as follows:
     <ul>
            <li><img border="0" src="images/combo%205.jpg" align=right width="100" height="100" hspace="10"> 
              2/3/12, 2/11/12, 2/10, 3/11 and 4/12 - these five combo tokens each 
              have a probability of 4/36, which is equivalent to either a 5 or 
              9 token. 
            <li>3/10 and 4/11 - these two combo tokens each have a probability of 5/36, which is 
	   equivalent to either a 6 or 8 token.
	   </ul>
       By selectively replacing a few of the 5, 6, 8 and 9 tokens with the combo tokens (not all of them!), 
	   then the overall resource payout of the game is unchanged, but the "rate" of payout is more 
	   uniform as different production numbers are rolled. It also allows players to get a more 
	   balanced range of numbers for resource production. The recommendation is to replace 
	   about 1/3 of the high probability tokens with the corresponding combo tokens.
		</ul>
	  <p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">b) Our Interpretation of Ambiguous Rules</font></b></p>
	  <p><ul>
	  <li>In Catan for 5 or 6 players, the inter-turn Special Building Phase (SBP) is considered a "turn". 
	  That means that a knight activation or development card purchase done during the SBP 
	  can be utilized immediately upon that player's next turn.
	  <li>A player can win during the inter-turn Special Building Phase (SBP) even though it is 
	  not immediately his turn. For example, achieving the longest road or building a city may 
	  put the player up to or over the winning VP score. Note that progress cards can only be 
	  "played" during the player's turn, so Victory Point cards earned outside of the player's 
	  turn cannot be counted until the player's turn arrives.
	  <li>In the 5-6 player expansion rules, the Special Building Phase (SBP) 
        is defined as occurring <i>at the end</i> of a player's turn. Therefore, 
        at the start of that game the first possible SBP occurs <i>after</i> the 
        first player completes his turn. No building is possible before the first 
        person rolls the dice. 
		<li>When playing Settlers or Seafarers, if a player purchases a development 
          card on his turn, <i>and</i> it is a Victory Point, <i>and</i> it gives 
          the player "game" points, then it may be played immediately and the 
          player wins the game. Any other development cards must be retained until 
          the player's next turn. 
        <li>If an opponent's knight placement "breaks" a player's route, any orphan roads or 
	  ships remain on the board as is. The ship movement rule continues to apply though, 
	  so orphan ships could be reused, one ship per turn.
	  <li>When using gold field hexes with <i>Cities & Knights</i>, the hex can 
        only produce resources, never commodities. 
      <li>In <i>Cities & Knights</i>, a merchant can only be placed on a regular 
        resource hex, not on a gold field hex. 
      <li>In <i>Cities & Knights</i>, the robber does not interfere at all with 
        the operation of the merchant. If the merchant and robber are on the same 
        hex, the 2:1 trading rate remains intact and the merchant is still worth 
        one Victory point. 
      <li>During the hex production phase, if there are not enough cards of a given 
	  resource left in the bank to supply the entire requirement, then no one is given 
	  cards of that resource, even if there are a few cards to cover part of the requirement.
	  <li>The rules on the Commercial Harbour card differ from the rules for the 
	  same card in the manual. The disagreement relates to who chooses the 
	  commodity to be "stolen". We have sided with the manual where the opponent 
	  chooses which commodity he wishes to give to the requesting player (assuming 
	  he has at least one commodity in his hand).
	    <li>If a player is denied any resources or commodities on a dice roll 
          (other than a "7") due to the robber being on a producing hex, should 
          this qualify him to use the aqueduct benefit? <b><font color="#009900">Yes</font></b>. 
          The rules do not specifically mention this case, so we use the intention 
          of the rules that "no resources" means "no resources" whether or not 
          they are suppressed by the robber. 
        <li>In the original basic game, the placement rules for the robber were 
		simple - anywhere except a sea hex or the desert hex. Since then, 
		many more types of hexes have appeared and the rules have become 
		ambiguous. Our interpretation is that the robber may only be placed 
		on a hex that yields resources or commodities (ie. has a yellow production 
		number token). Here is a summary of where the robber can be placed:
      <ul>
	        <li><b><font color="#009900">Yes</font></b> - basic resource hexes 
              (Forest, Pasture, Mountains, Hills, Fields), gold field hexes (from 
              <i>Seafarers of Catan</i>), river resource hexes (Mountains, Hills, 
              Pasture from <i>Rivers of Catan</i>). Another way to remember which 
              hexes can be robbed is that these are the only hexes that have the 
              yellow production number tokens. 
            <li><b><font color="#FF0000">No</font></b> - Desert hex, Sea hex, 
              Lake hex (from <i>Fishermen of Catan</i>), Swamp hex (from <i>Rivers 
              of Catan</i>), Oasis hex (from <i>The Caravans</i>), Castle hex 
              (from <i>Barbarian Attack</i>), trade hexes (Castle, Quarry, Glassworks 
              from <i>Traders & Barbarians</i>). Another way to remember which 
              hexes cannot be robbed is that these hexes do not have any yellow 
              production number tokens. 
          </ul>
	  <li>The pirate only affects ship placement and movement. Hence, if it is placed 
	  on a sea hex that contains a fishing ground tile, the production of fish tokens 
	  is not affected.
	  <li>The double-hex Barbarian Tile can either be left as a stand-alone item 
	  beside the playing board or it can be integrated into the sea hexes as part 
	  of the playing board. If it is integrated, then for the purposes of ship placement, 
	  the double hex is treated as two plain sea hexes. The Barbarian Ship has 
	  no effect on any ships placed on the double hex.
	  </ul>
	  <p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">c) Other Changes or Enhancements to the Game</font></b></p>
	  <p><ul>
	    <li><img src="images/miscellaneous%20costs%20web%20small.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="10"> 
          One annoying thing we found playing <i>Cities & Knights</i> and the 
          <i>Fishermen of Catan</i>, was continuously having to refer to the instruction 
          sheets to remember how to rebuild a destroyed city, or to see how many 
          fish could buy what. So, another modification that I did was to create 
          a <i>Miscellaneous Costs</i> card that detailed these rules. I printed 
          these on heavy card stock and attached them to the backs of the regular 
          <i>Building Costs</i> cards with 2 sided tape. This helped tremendously 
          as each player now has all of the building requirements right in front 
          of him. I have found several other similar cards on the Web where people 
          have created their own cards to provide the build options for <i>Fishermen 
          of Catan</i>. The difference is that I have added the cost of city repair 
          as well, as it is not provided on any other card. The new <i>Traders 
          & Barbarians</i> provides 4 similar cards for the <i>Fishermen</i> variant, 
          but these are the size of development cards and the writing is very 
          small. I like mine better! 
	    <li><img src="images/largest%20fleet%20web%20small.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="10"> 
          A thought came to me as we were playing with the <i>Fishermen of Catan</i> 
        variant. It is possible to win (or at least do very well) without ever 
        building on a fishing ground tile. To give additional encouragement for 
        building there, I created a <i>Largest Fishing Fleet</i> card, worth 2 
        Victory Points. This card works like the Harbormaster card. You get one fleet point for
		each settlement on a fishing ground (or lake hex), and 2 points for each city
		(and 3 for a citadel). The first
		player to achieve 3 fleet points gets the Largest Fleet card. If another player
		exceeds this, he gets to steal the card. This gives added impetus to 
		strive for multiple fishing ground (and lake hex) spots.
