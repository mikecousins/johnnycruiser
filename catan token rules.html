	  <p><b><font color="#3300FF" size="4">A. Background</font></b></p>
	  <p>While loafing around on the Web one day, I happened to encounter some 
        really nice painted wooden resource tokens made by Mayday Games. I don't 
        know for sure, but I think the set of twelve or so token shapes were originally 
        constructed to augment a game called <i>Le Havre</i>. Now, 5 of these 
        shapes coincidentally are sheep, brick, ore, grain and lumber. So as a 
        smart marketing ploy, Mayday re-bundled these tokens as a vaguely disguised 
        add-on to Catan. To get around any copyright infringements, they called 
        the bundle <i>Yucatan Tokens</i>. Get it? <font color="#990000">Yu</font>-<b><font color="#006600">Catan</font></b>! 
        The bundle contains 125 tokens (25 of each flavour) which are meant to 
        replace the resource cards from the regular game. <i>Note that there is 
        no token equivalent for the commodity cards in </i>Cities & Knights<i> 
        - only resource cards.</i> Anyway, they had to address a big issue - mainly 
        how to keep each player's resources private. People like to hide their 
        resource cards so when a monopoly or robber incident happens they don't 
        get shredded. The tokens are hard to keep private. Mayday's solution? 
        When playing, keep a hand over the tokens. Yeah, right! When the robber 
        calls, hold the tokens in both hands, shake them and then drop one. Yeah, 
        right again! There had to be a way to integrate the wooden tokens into 
        the game without aggravating the privacy concern, as the tokens are really 
        cool. Here's what I came up with.</p>
		<p> The resource cards have to stay in the game as they make it easy
		to hide them from other players. What if one could additionally collect
		resource tokens? To make this work, the tokens would have to be 
		more desirable than the corresponding cards, but also harder to obtain.
		The desireability factor was easy. Because the tokens are hard to
		keep private, why not just exempt them from the clutches of the robber
		(or the monopoly card). In other words, once you earn a token, it is
		yours forever until you spend or trade it. No player can grab it and it
		doesn't factor into the "greater than 7 cards" rule. That certainly makes it more 
		valuable than the corresponding resource card. </p>
		
      <p>To obtain a "rare" resource token, I thought of three methods. Firstly, 
        a person moving the robber has the option of drawing a random card from 
        a player (as normal), or taking a resource token matching the terrain 
        hex. This idea adds more meat to the decision as to where to place the 
        robber. Secondly, a city with added city walls would give the player the 
        option of choosing <i>one</i> matching token in place of a card when an 
        adjacent hex produces (the second resource or commodity must be a card). 
        The city wall would no longer increase the 7 card rule as the player can 
        now carry part of his resource inventory as protected tokens. This also 
        adds a nuance to the choice of where to place the city wall. Thirdly, 
        a citadel would give the player the option of taking <i>one</i> of the 
        resources as a matching token rather than a card (the other
		two resources / commodities must be taken as cards). These three cases
		together should provide the right mix of cards and tokens.</p>
		<p>One final rule would be that the resource tokens otherwise act as 
		regular resource cards and can be used by themselves or in 
		combination with cards to buy or trade during the game.  Also, if a 
		player is hit by the "greater than 7 cards rule", he can make his payment 
		to the bank substituting matching tokens instead of some or all of the 
		cards if he wishes.
		<p>The effects of the new token rules would be to make the robber 
		more "user friendly", and reduce the devastation caused by rolling a 
		7 or playing a monopoly card. Notice that in the previous description
		of the rules I use the word "option" a lot. There may be times (like near 
		the end of the game), when the player would rather have all his 
		resources in cards for the ultimate privacy. So, whenever a player 
		qualifies to earn a token, he may always take a matching card instead.</p>
		<p>As a final thought, I considered two ways of handling the supply of 
		unowned tokens. My first thought was to place the tokens directly on the 
		board at the beginning of the game, 3 or 4 on each corresponding hex. 
		This was visually appealing as each hex would be decorated with tokens.
		Players would draw their earned tokens from the corresponding hex.
		The impact would be that each hex would have a finite supply of tokens
		and city / robber placement would be critical. 
		Once the tokens were gone from a hex, only
		cards could be obtained. However, this seemed too drastic, and tokens 
		would become very scarce by the end of the game. I
		thought of various replenishment schemes such as adding one token to 
		each hex whenever a 7 was rolled, or when the barbarians attacked, but 
		it was just too complicated. Also there was the problem of having two 
		citadels or  walled cities on a hex with a single token left - who would get it?
		In the end I opted for having the entire supply located in the bank (just 
		like the resource cards). Not as visually appealing, but much easier
		to implement.

      <b><font color="#3300FF" size="4">B. The Rules</font></b></br> 
	  <p><img src="images/resource%20tokens.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      <i>Note: In the rules below, "</i>card<i>" refers to the original resource 
      cards supplied with the game, and "</i>token<i>" refers to the new wooden 
      pieces.</i> 
      <ul>
		<li>The resource <i>tokens</i> (sheep, brick, ore, grain and wood) are 
          used for buying and trading exactly like resource <i>cards</i>. Buys 
          or trades may use any mix of <i>cards</i> and <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>When a player places the robber on a resource terrain hex, he may 
          draw a <i>card</i> (not a <i>token</i>) from another player as per the 
          regular rules, or he may instead take from the bank a resource <i>token</i> 
          that matches the terrain hex. 
        <li>If a player upgrades a city with a city wall, that city now has the 
          ability to generate resource <i>tokens</i>. Later when an adjacent terrain 
          hex produces resources, the owner of the city may optionally take one 
          matching resource <i>token</i> instead of a resource <i>card</i> as 
          part of his earnings. The second resource or commodity must be taken 
          as a <i>card</i>.  Note: The city wall no longer  adds additional
		  protection  (+2 cards) for the handcount. Instead, it allows the player
		  to collect exempt tokens.
        <li>A citadel has the ability to generate resource <i>tokens</i>. When 
          an adjacent terrain hex produces resources, the owner of the citadel 
          may optionally take one matching resource <i>token</i> instead of a 
          resource <i>card</i> as part of his earnings. The other two resources 
          or commodities must be taken as <i>cards</i>. In the special case where 
          a citadel also has a city wall, then up to two resources may be taken 
          as <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>When the resource production is calculated, if the requested number of a given 
		flavour of token exceeds the balance in the bank, then none are distributed 
		and all players must take cards instead. Of course, if the players really want
		tokens and can come to an agreement, they may elect to reduce the 
		total demand for tokens by taking some cards
		instead, thereby allowing the bank to satisfy the remaining demand.
		<li>The "greater than 7 cards" penalty applies only to resource / commodity cards.
		Tokens are not included in the card count.
		<li>When returning resources to the bank to satisfy the "greater than 7 cards" 
		penalty, the player can optionally discard a token that matches a card rather 
		than discarding the card itself. In other words, the debt can be paid off with a mix 
		of  cards and tokens, as long as the tokens match individual cards that could 
		have been discarded.
		<li>Regular 4 for 1, 3 for 1 or 2 for 1 trades with the bank yield only
          resource <i>cards</i> not <i>tokens</i>. However, tokens can be used in combination
		  with cards as the items to be traded.
		<li>The <i>Aqueduct</i> city improvement yields only
          resource <i>cards</i> not <i>tokens</i>. 
		<li>When playing the <i>Commercial Harbour</i> card, the player may offer 
          resource <i>cards</i> or <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>The <i>Resource Monopoly</i> card only impacts resource <i>cards</i>, 
          not <i>tokens</i> 
        <li>The <i>Mining</i> and <i>Irrigation</i> cards earn resource <i>cards</i>, 
          not <i>tokens</i> 
        <li>The <i>Wedding</i> card only impacts resource / commodity <i>cards</i>, 
          not <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>The <i>Master Merchant</i> card only impacts resource / commodity 
          <i>cards</i>, not <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>The <i>Saboteur</i> card (4th edition rules) card only impacts resource 
          / commodity <i>cards</i>, not <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>The <i>Bishop</i> card can only be used to draw resource / commodity 
          <i>cards</i>, never <i>tokens</i>. 
        <li>In <i>Fishermen of Catan</i>, a player can trade fish for resource 
          <i>cards</i> but not for <i>tokens</i>. A player spending fish to draw 
          from another player may only draw from <i>cards</i>, not <i>tokens</i>. 
      </ul>
