        <h3>Day 16 (May 20) - Hangzhou to Huangshan (Tunxi)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_53.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Clothing update: None of us wore shorts in northern China, as Chinese frown on them. 
	  However, when we left Xi'an, I decided to break out the shorts. Several others followed 
	  suit. I've worn them every day since. To heck with the gawkers. Actually I think the Chinese 
	  are actually admiring (and envying) my muscular, shapely legs.</p>
	  <p>I watched the Chelsea / Man U FA cup final last night, which didn't end until almost midnight. 
	  As a result, I actually awoke at 6:40, so didn't get to breakfast until 7. Great breakfast. All of 
	  the hotels seem to have the best banana bread. Yumm!</p>
	  <p>We boarded the bus at 8:30 and did a tour around Hangzhou. I don't know what
	  happened, but we had a new local guide, Terry. Yvonne was gone.
	  Our first stop was at the tomb 
	  of Yue Fei, a great Chinese general who attacked the Jin to reunify China during the Song 
	  Dynasty. He was so successful in his campaigns, that the Song emperor became afraid
	  of him and had him killed. In retribution, the people later placed sculptures of four of the people
	  involved with his murder at the gravesite. Visitors used to spit on the statues or slap them,
	  but the statues are now protected behind iron fences. Yue Fei is still revered in China.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_54.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  Then it was off to West Lake (Xi Lu) and a boat trip around 
	  the lake. It is a beautiful lake with many bridges and pagodas. There were lots of people there as it was 
	  Sunday. West Lake has long been considered one of the scenic wonders of China, 
	  covering over 3 square miles. Originally the lake was an inlet off the estuary of the 
	  Qiangtan River, becoming a lake when the river began to silt up in the 4th century.
	  The lake had a tendancy to flood, so several dykes were built, including the Bai and
	  Su causeways.  The Su causeway takes its name from the Song dynasty poet, Su Dongpo,
	  who served as governor of Hangzhou. The boat trip was very interesting. The water was 
	  very yellow with silt, and I think I heard from Yvonne that the lake was only about 2 meters deep.
	  After leaving the boat we walked along a long, busy pathway over the causeway and
	  back to the bus.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_55.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	 Then we drove to a tea plantation. We saw how they harvested the tea leaves and 
	  then dryed them. We were shown how to tell the various qualities of spring and summer teas 
	  by sight, smell and taste. I was a failure and could only tell them apart by their price. 
	  There were lots of 
	  tea fields up and down the hillsides.</p>
	  <p>Then we went for lunch. Again, I didn't think it was the greatest - the cuisine in northern China 
	 was much better. Most things are served in a soup or broth and nothing loses it's head. 
	 Fish, chicken, etc - all come complete with head and eyeballs. Figure this out - rice is 
	 only grown in southern China, but we weren't served rice here. Every meal in northern 
	 China came with rice. Weird!</p>
	 <p>Then we boarded the bus again for a 4 hour ride to Tunxi (Huangshan City) in the Huang 
	 Shan (Yellow Mountains). China is certainly a land of contrasts. In the cities, you see stores 
	 selling Gucci, Polo, etc., auto dealers selling Ferrari's, Porsches, million dollar condos, etc. 
	 It is like any modern city in North America. However, when you get out into the country things 
	 are radically different. Our trip took us through some hilly countryside. There were small 
	 fields everywhere. The government owns all the land, and farmers are assigned 0.2 of an 
	 acre each. We saw many farmers (and their families) out in the fields. No machinery here, 
	 it's all done by hand. Winter wheat has just matured so they were cutting and threshing (ie.
	  banging it on the side of a bin) and then burning the stalks. All by hand! Others were 
	  flooding the wheat fields and transplanting rice from nursery crops. Two crops a year on 
	  the same land - winter wheat and rice. It must be a hard, basic life for the farmers.</p>
	  <p>The only "automation" we saw was using water buffalo to pull the ploughs in the rice 
	 paddies. Others were using hand hoes to route furrows in the rocky soil. Tedious hard 
	 work! We saw other unusual crops. For example, we saw fields of mulberry bushes. Not 
	 really a crop but used for the silk industry. The silk worms eat the mulberry leaves and 
	 then build their silky cocoons.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_56.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
     We passed numerous towns of maybe 1,000 or 2,000 people. There were paved streets, 
	 but only pedistrians and bicycles (with the odd motor bike). The peasants seem to ride 
	 their bikes to the fields and have nowhere else to go.</p>
	 <p>We arrived in Tunxi  about 5:30 and were given a couple of 
	 hours to clean up for dinner. Dinner was at a Chinese restaurant a short distance from the 
	 hotel. The food was excellent this time. A couple of the dishes were pretty spicy, but I 
	 really enjoyed it.</p>
	 <p>After dinner (9 PM) some of us ignored the bus and headed into the "ancient street" 
	 (Lao Jie) on foot. 
	  It was a very long, winding street with wonderful shops lining each side. There were 
	  almost no other peopleand the shop keepers didn't hassle us at all. The shops were 
	  all very interesting - wood and stone carvings, caligraphy shops, art galleries, food 
	  stores, etc. The shops were very old and the street was cobbled and for pedestrians 
	  (and bikes) only. I went into a chopstick store and they had a wonderful selection at all 
	  prices. The caligraphy shops were interesting with paint brushes, special inks, rice 
	  paper, etc. At one shop a girl was washing and stretching silk cocoons, and making 
	  silk stuffing for duvets. It was about a 20 minute walk back to the hotel, all along a 
	  riverside walkway. The crescent moon was out and it was still very warm.

        <h3>Day 17 (May 21) - Up the Mountain to Huang Shan Xihai</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_57.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  I woke up early and it was down to the breakfast shop at 6:30. Everyone was in for a 
	  shock. There was no fresh fruit, no cereal, no yoghurt, and only one juice (orange 
	  juice) which tasted like water. It was strictly Chinese food! Lots of folks upset, but 
	  this has been our only limited breakfast. All the others have been outstanding.</p>
	  <p>We headed off on the bus about 8:30. Our first stop was at the Unesco World 
	  Heritage site of Hongcun - a Chinese village dating to 1131 AD, not far from the 
	  village of Yixian. The buildings are mainly from the late Ming 
	  and Qing dynasties (1600's),  It is known as a "village in a Chinese painting". The
	  village is laid out in the shape of a water buffalo (using a little imagination!)
	  and is watered by a network of canals that feed the Moon Pond and South Lake.
	  The lakes represent the buffalo's stomach, while the canals represent the intestines.
	  The causeways and bridges are the buffalo's legs.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_58.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  From the parking lot we walked along the river in front of the village. As we
	  walked along, a farmer was coming towards us followed by his water buffalo.
	  I actually had to step aside to let the buffalo pass. That's the closest I had
	  ever been to the huge animal.</p>
	  <p>We crossed the river into the village via a causeway and a small bridge.
	   It was quite a large village of one and two story 
	  buildings, with very narrow passageways through the town. In the center was a 
	  small pond. The buildings are now inhabited by artisans of various types, and a 
	  large group of budding artists were spread throughout the town working
	  on their watercolour masterpieces. We visited a 
	  vegetable and meat market with strange vegetables and even stranger meat 
	  parts. It was quite hot there, temperatures were supposed to be 32 or 33. 
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_59.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  After the village, we drove to the base of Huang Shan (Yellow Mountain) for 
	  lunch. Along the way, we stopped by the side of the road to watch some farmers
	  and their water buffalo in the fields. I got some good pictures of them hard at work.
	  I don't know how they manage to work in the heat day after day.
	  Back to lunch! The restaurant was very busy. They first sat us indoors at typical "lazy 
	  susan" tables. Then they decided to move us outdoors to the outside tables. 
	  The tables were filthy, with beer bottles and cigarette packages strewn on the 
	  ground. And it was very hot. Yuck! Then they moved us back inside again to a 
	  private room that was very nice indeed. There we had a wonderful lunch. 
	  Lots of rice and other good stuff this time!</p>
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_60.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>After lunch we drove to the cable car that would take us up the mountain - 
	  about 5000 feet. The cable cars were huge and held about 100 people. There 
	  were just 2 cars, one going up and one coming down. I'm not sure why, but
	  we had to wait quite a while to board the cable car. There were a lot of
	  people waiting, so our group got split up over two cars. At the top we stepped
	   into refreshing cool air. The sky was sunny and the view was spectacular. 
	   We had about a 1 hour walk (with stops) up and down pathways to get to our 
	   hotel. All the food, excess bags, building materials, etc are packed up from 
	   the bottom by "yoke on the shoulder" porters. Wouldn't want that job! They 
	   even had sedan chairs for people who wanted to be carried around! We 
	   were given some free time to relax or do more hiking. Most of us headed 
	   off to see more spectacular views.</p>
	   <p>Dinner was at 7:00 and was excellent. The hotel was simple (a 3 star 
	   hotel), but it was clean and comfortable. The rooms all had twin beds (which 
	   some people grumbled about) and there was no internet. Some of us were 
	   getting up for the sunrise the next morning, so I went to bed right after dinner 
	   (8:30 or so). We had to be up by 4 AM and leave at 4:30 to hike to a good 
	   spot for viewing the 5:11 AM sunrise.

        <h3>Day 18 (May 22) - A Drive to Nanjing</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_61.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  I woke up at 3:30 this morning, so didn't chance going back to sleep. We met 
	  in the lobby at 4 and headed out with our flashlights. The sunrise was quite 
	  good, especially with the tremendous mountain view. There were lots of 
	  people at the site - Chinese, Japanese, and us. There are at least 5 hotels 
	  on the top of the mountain and they all seemed to be full. It was supposed 
	  to be quite cold in the morning and the hotel provided nice puffy blue parkas. 
	  However, I headed out in shorts and a sweatshirt, and ended up taking off the 
	  sweatshirt. It was probably about 12 or 13 degrees.</p>
	  <p>After the sunrise, we hiked back to the hotel and lounged around for our 
	  7:30 breakfast and for the rest of our sleepy head calssmates to appear. 
	  This was the first breakfast that hasn't been a buffet. We were served at the 
	  table and had rice crispies, toast and jam, and a plate of bacon and scrambled 
	  eggs. I really missed having my usual feed of fresh fruit and yoghurt, but it was 
	  still quite good.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_62.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  After breakfast we hiked about 1/2 hour to another gondola that went down 
	  (and up) a different slope of the mountain. We stopped at several view points
	   looking out over the mountains and valleys. It really was spectacular up on 
	   the mountain. The cool air was really refreshing too.</p>
	   <p>The cable car entrance was not too busy. Again the cars held about 100 people,
	   so our group all made it into the same cable car. 
	  Only a few can sit and the rest hang from ceiling handles like a rush hour bus. It 
	  really is a spectacular view as the mountain slopes are very steep.</p>
	  <p>Exiting the cable car was like stepping into a furnace. Back to 24 degrees 
	  again. We were now heading to Nanjing - a 5 hour bus ride away. Instead of 
	  stopping for lunch, Lois had preordered box lunches for us which we picked 
	  up from a local hotel. Then it was off to Nanjing.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_63.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  Once again we travelled through miles of hilly countryside, with terraced 
	  rice and vegetable fields in the valleys. We passed through many small 
	  villages with new and old houses, and dirt streets and some paved streets. 
	  The farmers were out in their fields in the intense heat, planting, ploughing, 
	  threshing, carrying stuff around. All back breaking work. There are definitely 
	  2 Chinas. If you are lucky enough to be one of the 40% born in the city, you 
	  have a chance at a good job, a nice apartment, a car, a chace to travel through 
	  the country, etc. However, if you are one of the unlucky 60% born in the country 
	  (where having 2 water buffalo is considered to be a sign of great wealth), you 
	  work every day sunrise to sunset scratching out a bare existance. It was 
	  humbling to be driving by these hard working people in our air conditioned bus.

	  We arrived at our hotel in Nanjing about 3. It is a gorgeous hotel - 
	  probably the best we've stayed in yet. The bedroom / sitting room is 
	  huge, with a sofa and coffee table area, a bar and a computer desk 
	  area. The bathroom is also huge with a separate tub and shower. 
	  There is a walk in closet with a sitting area! Pretty nice.</p>
	  <p>We headed out for dinner at 6:30. Once again we had an excellent 
	  Chinese dinner. The short ribs were exeptional. After dinner we went for a 
	  long walk around the hotel area. This is the first hotel that was in a seedier
	  part of the city. The road into the hotel was under reconstruction as well,
	  which made it seem more primitive. However, there were lots of people wandering 
	  around, so we felt really safe. We walked by lots of small shops and a couple
	  of large hotels. Very interesting! Then it was back to the hotel for the night.

	  A note on the teddy bears: Before I left for China, I had decided to take something 
	  representative of Canada to hand out to people that I met in China. I wanted to take 
	  Vancouver 2010 Olympic pins, but discovered that you had to buy them at $9 each.
	   I ended up going to the dollar store and getting a dozen small teddy bears and
	    teddy moose that had "Canada" and a red maple leaf embroidered on them. 
		The had small clips on them (for key rings?) which I could use to clip them on my 
		backpack so they dangled seductively from my pack (two at a time). I had to cut 
		off the little white tags as they said "Made in China". Anyway, I thought that it would 
		be children that wanted the bears, but not so. It was always adults (or teens) that 
		wanted them. Mainly teenage girls who would giggle when they asked. I'm down 
		to my last two bears now. Some of my classmates thought it was an excellent idea 
		and planned to do so themselves on their next trip. It took them a while to figure out 
		that I had a backpack full of bears, as when I give one or two away, suddenly I had 
		2 more hanging from my pack.</p>
		<p>I also took with me a 8 1/2 X 11 plasticized map of 
		the world that I carry in my backpack. We have met other travelers who don't speak 
		English and can point out where we each live. Also Chinese locals have asked 
		where we live and we can point it out. Most people don't know much about Canada 
		or where Calgary is.

      Notes on Nanjing: Nanjing has a population of about 6 million, and is the capital of 
	  Jiangsu province. It is located near the coast, on the banks of the Yangzi River, 
	  close to the magnificant Purple Mountain. This city of lakes is still enclosed within 
	  a grand city wall. In Chinese, "bei" means north, "nan" means south and "jing" 
	  means capital city. Hence, Beijing is the "Northern Capital" and Nanjing is the 
	  "Southern Capital". Nanjing was the capital of several kingdoms up to 220 AD. 
	  Later, it was China's capital under the early Ming Dynasty (1300's) and later yet 
	  the capital of the 19th century Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the first Chinese 
	  Republic under Dr. Sun Yat-sen and later Chiang Kai Shek. "Nanjing" is in Mandarin, 
	  and is called "Nanking" in Cantonese. On a notorious note, Nanjing is know as "one 
	  of the three great furnaces of China". That's referring to the summer temperatures, 
	  not the industrialization.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_65.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      As usual, breakfast was at 6:30. We were now back to our normal Chinese / American 
	  buffet breakfast with lots of fresh fruit, yoghurt and banana bread. I also had a made 
	  to order omelette with everything in it. It was a great breakfast. </p>
	  <p>It had rained overnight, and then started pouring with rain about 7:30. We boarded 
	  the bus with our unbrellas about 8:30 and headed out for the day. The first place we 
	  went to was the government buildings of the Chinese Nationalist Party from the 1920's. 
	  This was the centre of Dr. Sun Yat Sen's party, and the home of Chiang Kai Shek
	  (in fact called the "Chiang Kai Shek Presidential Offices"). 
	  from here, Chiang Kai Shek commanded a purge of the Chinese communists and 
	  Soviet advisors. The rooms have been decorated with period furniture restoring
	  how it looked in the 1920's. One of the main level rooms was a converted bomb
	  shelter.The buildings fortunately survived the Cultural Revolution of the 1960's.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_66.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  After that we went to 
	  visit the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Mausoleum (outdoors), where he is buried
	  (Zhongshan Ling). Dr. Sun Yat Sen, who was tolerant of the communists, is today 
	  revered as the father of nationalist China. Chiang Kai Shek, on the other hand, hunted 
	  down and killed some 30,000 communists, so is not at all popular in mainland China. 
	  The mausoleum and grounds are huge. Dr. Sun Yat Sen died in 1925 and a competition 
	  was held to design his tomb. The winner was Y. C. Lu, a graduate of Cornell University
	  School of Architecture. The tomb is approached up a long marble stairway of 392
	  steps and comprises a square hall with a lifesize marble statue of the Doctor. Behind 
	  the statue is a door leading to a round domed building that contains his 
	  sarcophagus inset into the floor. Behind the tomb building is a garden area with
	  flowers and trees.</p>
	  <p>On the way back to meet the group for lunch, I paused at a concession stand where
	  they had a cooler with Coke and Pepsi. I asked the lady for a Coke and she handed me a
	  Pepsi. So, I said "Pepsi" and she put it back and handed me a Coke. I think I'm beginning 
	  to speak Chinese!
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_70.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  Fortunately the rain had stopped by now, but it was very warm and extremely humid. 
	  All of us were just as wet as if had still been raining. What a sticky day!</p>
	  <p>Tennis note: While waiting for our bus near the ubiquitous souvenir shops, 
	  two vendors were demonstrating a tennis ball on a very long elastic string (just 
	  my type - the ball always comes back). They were taking turns hitting the ball 
	  with tennis racquets. I decided that dispite the heat and humidity, I would give
	  it a try. Well, my old squash skills must have come to the 
	  front as I was able to hit the ball just fine 
	  and had a good game with the vendor. James, our "guide in training"
	  even took my picture. If I wasn't sweating before the game, I sure was after!
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_67.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      After the mausoleum (and string tennis), we headed to an air conditioned restaurant 
	  for lunch. Boy, did that feel air conditioning good! Once again it was a wonderful lunch. 
	  Every meal we seem to have one or two local dishes that we haven't had before. Very 
	  nice!</p>
	  <p>Then we headed to the Yuhuatai Revolutionary Martyr's Museum that is a huge 
	  memorial to the communist fighters that died from Chiang Kai Shek's army. 
	  According to legend, Yuhuatai is where a 5th century monk gave a sermon that
	  was so moving that flowers rained down from the sky. Chinese visitors still
	  collect the coloured pebbles that are found here. Sadly, the [ark became an execution 
	  ground during the Chinese revolution (1927 - 1949), and thousands lost their lives
	  here. The Martyr's memorial consists of nine gigantic 30m high figues in typical Soviet
	  realist style. The 
	  sculptures are typical western communist motifs of peasants breaking their chains of 
	  bondage. Not very Chinesey at all. The afternoon was still overcast, but very, very humid.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_68.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      After the Museum, we were supposed to go to the Nanjing Massacre  (Rape of Nanking) 
	  Museum. This Museum documents the attrocities done by the occupying Japanese 
	  forces during the WWII. It was a holocaust similar to that in Nazi Germany, and over 
	  400,000 innocent Chinese died horrible deaths. However, the museum was closed for 
	  renovations. I was just as glad as the museum is very depressing.</p>
	  <p>Instead, we went to the remains of the government examination center. Government 
	  exams were started in Sui Dynasty times (581 - 618 AD). People wanting to join the civil 
	  service at the municipal, provincial or federal level had to write and pass a series of 
	  examinations. The site we visited was once many acres in size and had rows and rows 
	  of cubicles where 20,000 students sat for 3 days writing their exams. This was done twice 
	  a year. All that remains of the buildings (thanks to the Cultural Revolution) is a proctor's 
	  building and a few short rows of cubicles. Very interesting.

      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_69.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      We arrived back at the hotel again about 4 PM just as it started to rain again. Everyone 
	  was glad to walk into the A/C hotel and headed to their rooms to shower and clean up.</p>
	  <p>We left for dinner at 6:30. We had an interesting bus ride through narrow alleys, 
	  making cars back up and drivers shout. Lots of honking too! Dinner was very good. 
	  After dinner, some of us jumped off the bus part way home and visited a humungous 
	  night market. We wandered around for about an hour. It was mostly the same old stuff we 
	  had seen in the previous cities. One thing different was several stalls selling pet dogs, cats
	  and rabbits. I don't think we had seen this before in other night markets. The animals were
	  in tiny cages. At one stall our professor bought a Mahjong set. I had seen many very
	  nice sets on our travels and was sorely tempted, but I already have a Mahjong set and
	  who needs two? We grabbed a cab to get back to the hotel and arrived 
	  about 9:30. Time for bed.

        <h3>Day 20 (May 24) - Nanjing to Shanghai</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_73.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  We were up for our normal 6:30 breakfast and onboard the bus by 8 AM. It was raining 
	  slightly and very dark and misty. The drive from Nanjing to Shanghai took almost 4 hours. 
	  It was quite industrialized along the highway, so no one minded the reduced visibility. 
	  I'm sure glad that we had the sunshine for our 2 drives several days ago through the 
	  farmlands and countryside. All of the highways we have been on have been toll roads. 
	  We are constantly going through toll booths on our trips.</p>
	  <p>We arrived in Shanghai about noon. What a huge, bustling city. (Bustling means 
	  traffic jams!). The freeways are amazing with arial roads 7 or 8 stories high. We where 
	  midway up some of the office towers and could look way down to the streets below. 
	  The interchange ramps are the most complicated I've ever seen. In Shanghai you 
	  have to have special vehicle plates to use the arial highways. Out of towners must 
	  use the slower surface roads.</p>
	  <p> We headed directly to our restaurant. It was the nicest restaurant we had been to yet, 
	  with gorgeous red mahogany tables and chairs. Once again we sat at tables for 8 or 
	  10 with a lazy susan in the center. The lunch was excellent.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_74.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      After lunch we did 2 sightseeing stops. The first was to the Jade Buddha Temple, the most 
	  famous of Shanghai's many temples. It contains two jade Buddha statues that originally 
	  came from Burma. Next, we visitied the Yu Gardens and Bazaar. This is a huge complex 
	  with a bazaar surrounding a beautiful Chinese garden. In the garden is a much photographed
	   foot bridge that zigzags across a small pond. </p>
	   <p>Then we returned to the hotel about 4:30 and had till 5:30 to clean up. Once again we 
	   are at a top notch hotel. At 5:30 we boarded the bus and headed out for dinner. This restaurant 
	   was very nice and had silk embroidered pictures hung around the room. They were Chinese 
	   scenes and also copies of famous western masterworks. They were for sale, and the one I 
	   checked out was $5,000 US. A bit rich for me. Dinner was great. After dinner we were taken 
	   to a theatre for a performance of the Chinese acrobats. They were awesome. The tumbling, 
	   juggling and gymnastics were superb. They finished with 5 motorbikes in the steel mesh cage. 
	   I'd seen this on TV before but it was amazing live.</p>
	   <p>Back to the hotel by 9:30. To bed soon as we have another early start tomorrow as we 
	   visit some more sites in the city.

        <h3>Day 21 (May 25) - A Day in Shangai</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_75.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  We were up early again, breakfast at 6:30. We were on the bus at 8 ready to see Shanghai. 
	  Shanghai is difficult to see, not because it's so large, but because it is so smoggy. The downtown 
	  would be so beautiful, but buildings more than a block away melt into the smog and appear as 
	  grey or black lumps.</p>
	  <p>Our first stop was at "The Bund". This is the strip of European buildings (early 1900's) lining 
	  the west side of the Huangpu River. This was the financial center of the Enlish, American, French 
	  and German concessions during the early 20th century.  The river was very misty and the smog 
	  made the buildings look quite drab. However, we had a nice walk along the river.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_76.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  After wandering the Bund, we hopped back in the bus and headed off to a silk factory.
	  We've been very lucky this trip in that factories (ie. shopping) has played a very small role. On 
	  one of the flights we were intermingled with a group of 60 from a Uniworld tour. One fellow
	  was complaining to me that the whole trip seemed to be factories and shopping. Not so 
	  for us! Anyways, the silk factory was very interesting. We learned that the cocoons are either
	  single or double. Each cocoon is spun from a single thread of silk. If the cocoon is single,  then
	  the thread can be unwound (yielding about 1.5 Km of silk!). 
	  If double, then it can't. So, the double cocoons are stretched as is
	  to make a filling for a duvet or comforter. The single cocoons are combined in groups of
	  about 8 and unwound/twisted into a strong silk thread. </p>
	  <p>At the back of the factory was a large showroom with all sorts of silk products. I bought 
	  an embroidered silk placement for my Mom. A lot of our group bought one or more silk 
	  comforters which were squished flat to make them easier to carry on the flight home.
	  This was one factory tour that I enjoyed.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_77.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  Then we drove to the Shanghai Museum. It is a wonderful museum covering culture and 
	  art from 10,000 BC to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1912). The museum has 4 floors with a lot 
	  to see. This museum is organized differently than the one in Xi'an, which was chronological.
	  The Shanghai Museum is organized by medium. There are separate rooms for bronzes, pottery, 
	  calligraphy, furniture, paintings, etc, We were only given 1 hour, and I had to move very quickly 
	  to cover all 4 floors. Fortunately the museum wasn't too busy so one could see a lot
	  even in the short time. One very
	  interesting exhibit displayed coins and paper currency from 2,000 BC to the present.
	  I'm not sure if all the items displayed in the 
	  museum are original. There were several items that were
	  identical (to the best of my memory) to items we saw at the Shaanxi Museum in Xi'an.
	  For example, one large sculpture was of a trader and his camel. I'm positive that I saw
	  exactly the same thing in Xi'an. One of them must be a copy!
	  The museum had a very interesting gift/book shop. A number of our group purchased interesting
	  books.</p>
	  <p>Then we drove to a restaurant for lunch. Once again, lunch was delicious. I think I am 
	  actually going to miss Chinese food when I get back to Calgary.
     <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_78.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	   After lunch we drove to a 
	  small building that was  the site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. 
	  Lots of history and stuff about Mao Zedong and his buddies. It doesn't seem to be an important 
	  monument for the Chinese people, a result of the overwhelming resentment of Mao's policies 
	  and particularly the Cultural Revolution. The rooms had been refurnished in period furniture and
	  life size figures of the congress attendees sat around a large table. I can understand why the
	  congress met in this location as there was a large Starbucks only a block away!</p>
	  <p>We returned to the hotel about 3 PM so that we could clean up for dinner. We seem to 
	  spend a lot of time cleaning up. We are a dirty lot!  
	  Rather than cleaning up, I decided to work on my journal. I can clean up when I get back
	  to Calgary!</p>
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_79.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>At 6 PM we headed off to a restaurant for dinner - probably Chinese. The plan was to 
	  do outr long awaited gift exchange before eating dinner. I think I mentioned 
	  earlier about purchasing my gift in Beijing. I was ready! It's one of those "pick from the pile 
	  or steal someone else's" gift exchange. I don't think anyone realized how long it would take
	  us to do 32 gift selections! We were sat in a large circle and handed numbers. I think we
	  spent 2 hours before the dust had settled and the final gift was stolen / opened. The
	  staff seemed to enjoy the hilarity as much as we did. It was good fun. The gifts were
	  wonderful - people had put a lot of thought into their purchases. I ended up with
	  a set of musical balls. Something to do with good health. Finally, we were done 
	  and got to eat dinner. Dinner was wonderful.
     <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_80.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  After dinner the bus headed back to the hotel. Some of us jumped ship along the way and walked
	  down Nanjing Road to the pedestrian mall area. The guide had suggested that it was only a short 
	  walk to the mall, but I think we walked for over 1/2 hour to get there. It was a long way!
	  It was dark out and the buildings were all lit
	  up in flashing neon. There were lots of people strolling around the mall. There was even
	  a live jazz band and people were ballroom dancing. Four of us stopped into
	  a McDonald's for ice cream cones. They were great! That was our first visit to a
	  fast food outlet in China.</p>
	  <p>Most of the group decided to cab it back 
	  to the hotel, but Donna and I decided to walk back. We retraced our steps back along Nanjing 
	  Road, and turned down Maoming Road towards the hotel. A good part of the road was under 
	  construction so we had to walk over uneven dirt and crumbling brick. A poor choice of
	  route, but how was I to know? We did make it back to the hotel safe and sound though.
	  Another great day!

        <h3>Day 22 (May 26) - Traces of my Ancestors</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_81.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Today is the last day of our China trip. While I'm looking forward to getting home again, I know
	  I will miss the country, the food and the camaraderie of the group. but the whole trip has been just great.</p>
	  <p>Today was a morning on our own. I had my own special plans. I wanted to visit the home of my
	  ancestors. My great aunt and great uncle lived in Shanghai for 21 years, from 1920 to 1941. My great uncle
	  worked for P&O Steamship Lines which had an office in Shanghai. These were years of turmoil
	  in China, seeing the war between the CCP and the KMT, and the occupation by the Japanese.
	  My father also lived for a year in Shanghai, around 1930 and worked in a lithography factory. While
	  the depression was raging in North America, there were still jobs to be had in China.</p>
	  <p>My cousin lived his early years in Shanghai and now lives in Victoria. He was able to provide me
	  with a description of the row housing where they lived and how to find it. He had been back 
	  to visit in 1990 and
	  things were pretty well as he remembered.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_82.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  It was about a mile or so walk from our hotel to the Jing'an Temple on West Nanjing Road 
	  (formerly known as Bubbling Well Road). The housing could be found just 1 block east of the temple.
	  As I was walking along Nanjing road, I was diverted across the street by some uniformed policemen.
	  There I encountered several vans full of police and even 2 tour buses full of police. There were also
	  plain clothes police wandering through the crowd that had gathered. I have no idea what it was all
	  about, but presumeably some notable was in town.</p>
	  <p>Continuing on, I arrived at the area where the housing should have been. Progress had obliterated 
	  all traces of the homes. There was now a huge shopping complex right where my relatives used to live.
	  across the street were two high rise buildings, with construction cranes working on several more. I took
	  some photos of the area and then continued a further block west to the Jing'an Temple. It had been
	  rebuilt in 2002 (or so) and looked brand new.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_83.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  I crossed the street southwards to Jing'an Park. This is where the original bubbling well and foreigner's
	  cemetery used to be. I wandered all through the park but couldn't find any trace of them. It was
	  a beautiful park with lots of trees, open grassy spaces and a pond with lotus flowers. Once again there
	  were numerous groups doing Tai Chi and other rythmic exercises. One area had wonderful birdsongs
	  coming from the trees. Not having noticed many birds in Shanghai (pollution?), I went in for a
	  closer look. It turned out that people had hung small cages in the trees with singing birds inside. I
	  guess that's one way to get singing birds in the trees!</p>
	  <p>Fronting
	  the park was another shopping complex and an outdoor amphitheater. There was a corporate
	  rah-rah meeting taking place in the amphitheater for the AstraZeneca Pharmeceutical Co., whoever they 
	  are.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_84.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  On the return trip home I took a side road to see some of the older shops and buildings. There were 
	  lots of people sitting on the edge of the street selling fruits and vegetables. Some had bikes with
	  their produce in a large box on the back of the bike. One group of vendors had live chickens and 
	  would kill and clean them right in front of you. At least you would know that the chicken was fresh!
	  All along the street were small shops selling various items. Some were restaurants (sort of!). I stopped
	  into one very interesting bookstore and almost bought a book or two.
	  It was hot and I was thirsty, so I stopped at a small grocery store 
	  and bought a Coke. The standard price (in the older sections of town) seemed to be 3 yuan for an
	  ice cold 600 ml plastic bottle of Coke (or Pepsi). That's only about 45 cents Cdn. Not bad!</p>
	  <p>Then it was time to head back to the hotel and get ready for the flight home. I really enjoyed
	  my morning on my own and felt quite comfortable walking around the city. I had memorized the
	  street names beforehand and had no trouble finding my way back even though I took a very
	  circuitious route. I was kind of sad to be leaving China and took my time getting back to the hotel.

		We had to have our bags out by noon. We hopped into the bus for the last time and headed off
		to the airport. This was the second time to the airport today for some of the class. Why? There is a
		much hyped MagLev train from Shanghai to the airport that takes just 8 minutes and reaches about 
		430 mph. Several of the class decided to spend their "morning on your own" doing a round
		trip via the MagLev train. We checked in to the flight and settled down to wait for the departure. 
		It was lunch time and the only meal not included in the travel package. I found a place selling
		sandwiches and Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars. Fortunately the airport prices were quite
		inflated so that I used up all of my Chinese money right down to the last yuan.</p>
		<p>The flight  to Vancouver was long but uneventful. Takeoff had been delayed a half hour or so, 
		so we had a very tight connection time in Vancouver. We had to claim our bags and go through 
        Canadian customs. Customs was very busy, but fortunately they had a special line for
		passengers with tight connections. We ran to our Calgary flight with about 20 minutes to spare. 
		The flight to Calgary was fine and we arrived in Calgary on time. Marjorie was there to meet me. She
		seemed upset which was strange as I had been away on my own before. However, it
		turned out that she had to have one of our elderly cats (Muffy) put down that morning. Poor
		kitty aside, it was great to be back home.
