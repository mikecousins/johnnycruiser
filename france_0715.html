    <p>It had been 3 years since our last river cruise and we decided that it was time to 
	hit the river again. Of course a single cruise wasn't enough, so Marjorie looked for 
	two cruises that we could "back-to-back". We really wanted to do the Rhone River 
	in France so started by choosing a Uniworld cruise (that offered T/A rates) from Lyon 
	to Avignon. We also wanted to try an AMA  cruise (that offered T/A rates) in Germany,
	but the closest fit still left 7 days between the two cruises. So, we opted to
	do an intervening land tour, 2 days in Avignon and 5 days in Brussels. The Rhine
	cruise that we chose did a 2 day pre-stay in Prague, then Nuremberg to Luxembourg
	on the Main / Rhine / Mosel rivers. The travel
	logistics of our trip would be: fly to Lyon, cruise to Avignon, train to Brussels, fly to Prague,
	bus to Nuremberg, cruise to Luxembourg (Remich), fly home. We had to plan hotels for
	Lyon (1 night), Avignon (2 nights), Brussels (5 nights) and Prague (2 nights). Lots to
	organize!</p>
	<p>It was a very busy trip that took us to 36 cities / towns / villages, most of which
	we had never been to before. As a result,
    I have arbitrarily split this trip into three diaries - this one covering the first
	river cruise, Lyon through Avignon,
	a second diary covering the land portion of our trip,
	<a href="belgium_0715.html"> Avignon and Brussels</a>,
	and a third diary covering the second river cruise,
	<a href="rhine_0715.html"> 
    Prague through Luxembourg</a>.</p>
	  
    <p>The Rhone River cruise was with Uniworld, our fourth cruise with them. The ship,
	the S.S. Catherine, was gorgeous. The latest innovation was a small indoor swimming 
	pool, although it didn't get much use. The service and food were excellent. My only
	complaint was the late dining time - 7:00 PM. <i><b>Note:</b> In 2012 
      Uniworld offered free beer and wine at meals only, while Scenic Tours offered 
      free drinks any time of the day. This year Uniworld has free drinks at 
     any time of the day. Yahoo!</i></p>
	 <p>The cruise was not full - only 121 passengers with room for 159 total. Perhaps
	 that's why they were offering T/A rates. We met a number of T/A's on the cruise.
	 It was a hot cruise, with temperatures being in the mid 30's each day with lots of sun.
	 The northern half of the cruise was in the Rhone-Alps region, while the southern half
	  was in the Provence region. We actually hit the Burgundy region as well when we 
	  popped up to Beaune. Finally, there were 3 "pay for" optional excursions offered, 
	  but we didn't do any of them. People who went seemed to enjoy them.

    <b>July 10</b> - The airport shuttle picked us up from home about noon and
	we were at the airport by 12:30. We had lots of time to check in and do security.
	After boarding the flight to Frankfurt, we sat at the gate for about an hour. We 
	never did hear any explanation for the delay. We had a 4.5 hour connection time in Frankfurt,
	so the delay was inconsequential in the bigger view. At Frankfurt, we were bused from the plane
	to the terminal building, went through EU customs, reclaimed our checked luggage, walked
	a mile to another terminal building, rechecked our luggage, went through security and
	finally got to our departure gate with lots of time to spare. Once again we were bused to the 
	plane and then set off for Lyon.
    <p><b>July 11</b> - We arrived in Lyon about 2:30 PM and had pre-arranged a shuttle to 
	the hotel (Marriott).
	Fortunately they had a room ready for us. The hotel was set next to a huge park with 
	gardens and a large lake. We walked around the park gardens for a while and then
	went for a beer in the hotel. It was really hot out! We finally packed it in by 6:30 PM and 
	did the sleeping pill trick. Had a good sleep!

      We woke up early and had to read for a while waiting for the 7:00 AM breakfast to open.
	  After breakfast we headed out to the park and decided to walk right around the lake. It
	  took us about 40 minutes, quicker than I thought. Lots of walkers, runners and bikers
	  everywhere. It was a beautiful park! We were back to the hotel to check out at 11:00 AM.
	  We caught a cab and were to the ship dock in less than half an hour. The dock was right 
	  in the core of the city. We checked in to the ship, dumped our carry-ons in the cabin and 
	  then had lunch. Afterwards we did a walk across the bridge to Presqu'ile and walked
	  around the downtown area. We were looking for a grocery store but, being Sunday, not 
	  much was open. We really enjoyed our walk despite the heat. Just along the dock from 
	  our ship was a huge swimming pool complex with 3 pools for swimming lengths,
	  family fun and a wading pool. Back on board, muster was 
	  at 5:00 PM and we sailed at 6:00 heading north to Macon.  We were at the northernmost 
	  navigable point  of the Rhone River, so had to switch to the Saone River to continue
	  north. Meanwhile, I managed to squeeze in the Wimbledon final while waiting for dinner.
	  Dinner was at 7:00 and we were back to our room by 9:00. Once again it was sleeping pill 
	  time and I would be switched onto local time by tomorrow.

    We were up early at 6:00 and checked email until breakfast time. We had arrived 
    at Macon overnight. Our 9:00 AM tour today took us (by bus) about an hour 
    north to Beaune, right in the heart of the Burgundy region. Yes, it really 
    does exist! Along the road we stopped at a vinyard belonging to Puligny-Montrachet 
    to check out the grapes. Once in Beaune, we did a short "get your bearings" 
    tour of the town and then were left for two hours on our own to explore the 
    village and have some lunch. Our first priority was to find the famous Fallot's 
    mustard shop. It wasn't far and Marjorie got some mustard for the kids. We 
    continued to walk around the village and discovered a small alleyway restaurant 
    for lunch. I had a wonderful salad and a local beer. It was quite warm out by now,
	hitting 31 degrees. Our time had run out, 
    and we met back in the central square for a tour of the famous <i>Hospices 
    de Beaune</i> charity hospital, founded in 1443. It was a large complex and
	very interesting. At 2:45 we reboarded our bus and drove back to our ship in 
	Macon. We spent an hour or so reading and then watched the sail away at 5:00.
	At 6:00 there was a Captain's reception followed by dinner. I had veal fillet.
	We watched as the ship passed through a lock and then headed to bed.

      Overnight, we sailed south on the Saone River to the confluence with the Rhone in Lyon. We
	  were already there when we woke at 6:00. It was going to be a hot day - forecast for 34 degrees.
	  We had planned to look for a grocery store at some point  today as things were closed two days ago 
	  owing to it being a Sunday. But we were stymied again  because today was Bastille Day (like July 1 
	  in Canada or July 4 in the US) and everything was closed! 
	  We had breakfast and then headed off on separate tours, about 9:00 AM.
	 Marjorie did a "Lyon Gourmet" tour
	  that toured the old town and then visited a market where gourmet foods could be found. It
	  included a wine tasting with various finger foods to sample.
	  I joined a biking tour with 14 other riders for a 12 km tour of the city. I hadn't ridden in a while 
	  and it was going to be stinking hot, but I felt I was up for it. The first part of the tour
	  was great. There is a wide pedestrian area along the east bank of the Rhone with lots
	  of room for bikes, runners and walkers. We rode south unimpeded with our Vox devices
	  on as our guide told us facts about the city. Lovely!

    When we reached the point where the Saone runs into the Rhone, we crossed 
    a bridge over to the Presqu'ile area where there was no bicycle pathway. The 
    Presqu'ile is a peninsula of land formed between the Saone and the Rhone, 
    which run parallel to each other. From here we headed north facing traffic 
    lights, crosswalks and city traffic. When we got to the old town we parked 
    our bikes and did a walking tour. Then we jumped back on our bikes and continued 
    north a ways past where our ship was docked. We did another bridge across 
    to the east side of the Rhone and encountered the wonderful parkway again, 
    on which we rode back to the ship. We were back by 12:30 and ready for
	lunch. For the afternoon we relaxed and read and wandered the dock area. 
	It was too hot to go far. For dinner I had penne pasta. At 9:00 PM we
	headed back ashore for a city lights tour. Three double decker buses were 
	waiting for us, but only 8 people showed up. We sat as a small group 
	with our tour guide on one of the open top buses and had a private tour of the city.
	We were back at the ship by 10:00 in time for the 10:30 Bastille Day fireworks show.
	From the top deck of our ship we had an excellenrt view of the show. The fireworks
	were launched from the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourviere that we had seen
	close up during our bike tour. Then it was to bed. My best ever Bastille Day!!

     Today we would be visiting the "twin" villages of  Tournon and Tain l'Hermitage.
	 They are on opposite sides of the Rhone River, separated by a small bridge,
	 much like Buda and Pest (except on a much, much smaller scale). In fact, not only
	 are they separate villages, they are in separate regions of France! 
	 (The Rhone River is the boundary between the regions). We were up at 
	 7:00 on this warm day forecast to hit 34 degrees. We had breakfast and then set out
	 on a walking tour of the villages. We crossed over  the bridge to Tournon and 
	 explored around the village. Then we recrossed the bridge and did the same thing
	 around Tain l'Hermitage. We were grouped into four walking groups, and each group went
	 to a different winery for a tasting (to keep the tasting sessions small). Our group
	 went to the winery of M. Chapoutier. We tasted wines from the St. Joseph and the
	 Hermitage appelations. After the tasting we had about 15 minutes before the ship was sailing.
	 We hustled to a chocolate shop so Marjorie could buy some French chocolate. We made
	 sure that we left the shop before some of the other cruisers that were doing the same thing so
	 even though we got to the ship a few minutes late, we weren't the last ones! (There were 7 more after us).

	 We had lunch aboard as we set sail for Viviers. We planned to spend some time sitting on the top 
	 deck and watching the scenery, but it was very hot and the sun shades were collapsed due to 
	 some oncoming low bridges. At 3:00, Marjorie went to a cooking demo on making Crepe Suzettes.
	 While she cooked, I did some reading and enjoyed the view from our "balcony" window. Our
	 wall-to-wall window was split  horizontally and the top pane was motorized to go up and down 
	 (like a car window), so the top half of the window could be opened. A second motor drive raised 
	 and lowered a bug screen. We attended the port talk at 6:45 and then had dinner as we arrived 
	 in Viviers. I had the veal fillets which were very good. Viviers is a small village (pop. 3,500). For
	 our after dinner stroll  (9:00 PM) we walked the short distance into the town and wandered around until
	 the sun started to set. It was a lovely little town and we were looking forward to the guided tour tomorrow.

     We were up by 7:00 and attacked our breakfast. The omelet chef, Giorgi from Bulgaria, knew my 
	 likes by now and always did mine "with everything". Then we were off on our tour.
	 We had been told that a guide named Francis
	 was the best, so we asked to be in her group. She was a very interesting and spry lady of about 70 
	 years of age. We were split into four walking groups and each promised a treat at the end of the tour.
	  We did a walking tour of the village, taking a winding road up a hill to the top
	 where we had an excellent view of the village. Also on top was the Cathedrale de Viviers where
	 we were treated to a short organ recital of works by local composers. Lovely! Then we walked 
	 back down into the village for our "treat". Francis took us to her home - a 400 year old, three
	 story house, part of a row of buildings built against the hill. The house was a real maze - passing through
	 one room to get to another, stone staircases that only went  up one flight, secret passageways, etc.
	 None of the rooms were on the exact same level - always a step or two up or down from room to room.
	 Someone mentioned that there were 11 bedrooms, but I think there were a bit less. The house had a lot
	 of history and Francis was proud of her family who, during the years of WW-II, harboured over 
	 200 Jews on their way to safety.

	  A lovely "backyard" patio and garden was accessed from the kitchen on the top floor at the back of the house 
	  high up due to being built against the hill. Outside on the patio we were served wine, cheese, crackers and goodies
	  that turned out to be provided by the ship. Anyway, it was really a nice treat. We were back onboard  in
	  time for lunch and heard about the other three group "treats". There was another house visit, an outdoor wine 
	  and cheese tasting, and a dance presention. After lunch there was an optional (and rather expensive) tour to
	  a truffle farm and Chateauneuf-du-Pape. However, we weren't interested in truffles, and were going to be doing 
	  a visit to Chateauneuf-du-Pape on a Viator tour later when we would be staying in Avignon (after
	  the cruise). For the rest of us we were sailing to the small village of Chateauneuf-du-Pape (not to be 
	  confused with the appelation or area of Chateauneuf-du-Pape where the famous wines come from)
	  to pick up the optional tour group (at about 6:00 PM). For dinner I had an excellent rack of lamb as we continued
	  to sail to Avignon. After dinner we did a quick walk along the waterfront of Avignon, where an arts festival
	  was underway. There was a large market selling food, clothing, handicrafts, etc and a huge ferris wheel.
	  It was getting dark so we headed back aboard for bed.

     We were up at 6:30 on another hot 36 degree day. We had breakfast and then headed out on a 
	 walking tour of Avignon old town. There was an all day optional tour ($$$) offered for a cooking class
	 at the famous La Mirande Hotel, but most of us opted for the shorter walking tour. 
	 As we exited the ship, immediately 
	 ahead of us was the famous Pont d'Avignon (officially Pont St. Benezet ), constructed in the 12th century
	 and washed away several times. With
	 its three arches it appears to span half way across the river. However, the left bank is actually an island, so the 
	 original complete bridge had 22 arches, crossing both legs of the river plus the island in between.
	 Nearby the ship were the fairgrounds and ferris wheel we had explored last night but this wasn't
	 part of the walk. Instead, our tour took us past
	 the city walls and fortifications, and through the old town. It was hot!!

	 We spent most of the time 
	 exploring the Pope's Palace. It was built during the period 1309 - 77, when the popes took up residence 
	 at Avignon instead of at Rome, primarily because of the current political conditions. I guess the pope 
	 build such a large palace
	 to show the peasants what a great guy he was. The palace complex was huge. It is now mainly
	 empty and devoid of the murals and frescos that once covered the walls and ceiling. Still impressive though.
	 Walking through the streets of Avignon, we encountered many buskers and groups advertising  for
	 live theatre, concerts, etc. This was all to do with the annual arts festival.
	 We were back to the ship by 12:30, in time for lunch. For the afternoon, we relaxed in the air conditioned ship
	 reading, checking email, wandering around, etc. We did do a short walk along the dockside to see some other
	 cruise ships, and Marjorie actually invited herself aboard a Viking ship and was given a bit of a tour while
	 I sat outside in the shade and waited. Then it was back into the air conditioning.
	 For our "farewell" dinner I had chateaubriande. Very good, but calling it "farewell" was kind of jumping the gun. 
	 To bed.

     Up at 6:30 to another 36 degree day. Phew. Breakfast time again. We were still in Avignon. The
	 plan for today was a morning bus ride to explore Arles as the ship sailed to Tarascon. We would 
	 bus to Tarascon after the tour in time for lunch. Then there was an afternoon tour of Tarascon.
	 So, we joined the tour group at the buses (9:15) and headed off on a 45 minute ride to Arles.
	 At Arles, we were dropped off at the gates to the old town and marched to the famous Roman 
	 amphitheatre. It was quite large and reminded me of the coliseum in Rome.  After viewing the theatre, 
	 we continued around the old town visiting churches and gardens. The main church was the Church of 
	 St. Trophime. We were given some free time to browse around on our own. Vincent Van Gogh lived
	 in Arles and painted many of its landmarks. We saw a number of signs in front of buildings showing 
	 his painting of the building so that you could compare. After our time was up it was back to the 
	 bus to transfer to the ship at Tarascon. It had been a really hot morning and we were wiped! Nice to
	 be going back to the ship. Along the way there were fields of various crops, but the most colourful were
	 the fields of sunflowers.

	 We had lunch and still felt that we were all toured out, so decided to skip the Tarascon walking
	 tour. However, a while after the tours had left we felt better so decided to explore the town on 
	 our own. It was mid-afternoon so the streets were empty (siesta time). In southern France most 
	 of the businesses close from 1:00 to 4:00 (or there abouts). We enjoyed our walk around especially
	 the  medieval castle (Chateau de Tarascon) and the church (St. Martha's Church). At the castle we 
	 crossed the drawbridge and explored the castle. Some of the inner areas were open to the public, 
	 while other areas you needed a ticket. We just did the public areas. It was really hot
	 by this time. Time for the ship! We were back 
	 to the ship about 4:00 and had a drink in the lounge. We read for a while to fill in the time until
	 dinner and did some of our packing. For dinner I had pork medallions. Very good. Then it was 
	 back to our room to finish packing. Unlike ocean cruising, we didn't need to put out our luggage
	 until 8:30 AM tomorrow, but we still completed our packing ready to go. Then it was time for bed.

      We woke up at 6:30 on our last day of the cruise. It was going to be another 35 degree day. Looking 
	  out of our "balcony" window the river was dead calm, with beautiful reflections of  some houseboats
	  docked across the river. We had our final breakfast and said goodbye to
	  our new friends.  We put out our luggage and sat in the lounge waiting for our departure time. The
	  ship had organized a taxi for us, so all we had to do was wait. At 9:00 AM we did our final trip down
	  the gangplank and met our taxi. Our bags were there ready to load into the cab.  We hopped in and 
	  directed the driver to take us to the Adagio Access Hotel near the TGV station. It had been a great
	  cruise. 
	  <p>We appreciated several changes that Uniworld had seemingly
	  recently made. Firstly the "all the time" drink
	  package was really nice. Secondly the splitting of the groups for separate wine tastings was nice 
	  as the group size wasn't overwhelming. Lastly, the addition of guided bike tours in some of the ports was 
	  great. One thing we did miss was the variety of local musicians brought on for the evening entertainment.
	  Instead we seemed to get a lot of the ship's pianist  / singer combo most evenings. Cost cutting?</p>
