      <p>We first played Catan in early 2007, and it really caught on with us. 
        We now play it at least once a week with the family and occasionally with 
        others. We started with the basic game (<i>Settlers of Catan</i>) and 
        soon added <i>Seafarers of Catan</i> and then <i>Cities & Knights</i>. 
        As well as getting the expansion packs (for 5 to 6 players), we also obtained 
        the <i>Fishermen of Catan</i> and <i>The Great River</i> expansion sets. 
        Recently, we addded the <i>Traders & Barbarians</i> expansion that was 
        released in 2008. In general, we like all of the expansion sets and often 
        play complicated layouts that include many of the features. See the layouts 
        below for further information.</p>
      <p>One addition that we aren't sure about is the deck of dice cards. The 
        advantage of using the cards rather than the dice is that the production 
        numbers are statistically distributed - that is, <i>sixes</i> and <i>eights</i> 
        will come up most often, and <i>twos</i> and <i>twelves</i> will come 
        up rarely. This certainly rewards the player who establishes settlements 
        on the high yield numbers. But for some reason, the statistical eccentricities 
        of the dice - where, for example, three may come up more often than eight 
        - adds something to the game that gives everyone hope.</p>
      <p><a href="images/miscellaneous%20costs%20web.jpg" target=_blank> 
	  <img src="images/miscellaneous%20costs%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
        </a> One annoying thing we found playing <i>Cities & Knights</i> and the 
        <i>Fishermen of Catan</i>, was continuously having to refer to the instruction 
        sheets to remember how to rebuild a destroyed city, or to see how many 
        fish could buy what. So, another modification that I did was to create 
        a <i>Miscellaneous Costs</i> card that detailed these rules. I printed 
        these on heavy card stock and attached them to the backs of the regular 
        <i>Building Costs</i> cards with 2 sided tape. This helped tremendously 
        as each player now has all of the building requirements right in front 
        of him. You can click on the building cost card picture to the left in 
        order to see the card in more detail.</p>
      <br clear="left">
      <p><a href="images/largest%20fleet%20web.jpg" target=_blank> 
	  <img src="images/largest%20fleet%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
        </a>A thought came to me as we were playing with the <i>Fishermen of Catan</i> 
        variant. It is possible to win (or at least do very well) without ever 
        building on a fishing ground tile. To give additional encouragement for 
        building there, I created a <i>Largest Fishing Fleet</i> card, worth 2 
        Victory Points. This card works like the Harbormaster card. You get one fleet point for
		each settlement on a fishing ground (or lake hex), and 2 points for each city
		(and 3 for a citadel). The first
		player to achieve 3 fleet points gets the Largest Fleet card. If another player
		exceeds this, he gets to steal the card. This gives added impetus to 
		strive for multiple fishing ground (and lake hex) spots.</p>
      <br clear="left">
      <p><a href="catan%20citadel%20rules.html" target=_blank> 
	  <img src="images/red%20citadel.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10" width="120" height="125"> 
        </a> Another change we made for the "big board" game was to create a 
        new city type, between a city and a metropolis. One of the major annoyances 
        while playing is that the robber tends to move between two or three "hot 
        spots". Sometimes your best hex lies in drought because the robber spends 
        most of his time there. It would be nice if a player could somehow exempt 
        himself from this fate. Hence, the citadel (click on the citadel piece 
        for the detailed rules). In a nutshell, a city can be upgraded to a citadel 
        (one per player) for a cost of 5 resources (one of each flavour). The 
        citadel is exempt from the Barbarian attack and from the robber, and is 
        worth three Victory Points.

      <p><a href="catan%20token%20rules.html" target=_blank> 
	  <img src="images/catan_token_set.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
        </a> I developed a further enhancement  when I found some wooden resource 
		tokens from Mayday Games. I liked the tokens so much I had to find a way
		to integrate them into the game. The solution I came up with was to have them 
		compliment and act like the existing resource cards, but to make them 
		exempt from the robber and harder to obtain. In other words, they act like
		resource cards when buying or trading, but they are more valuable as
		they cannot be stolen by the robber. Click on the token photo to see
		the rules in detail.</p>
		<br clear="left">
		<p>We also have a set of 
		<a href="catan%20additional%20rules.html">additional house rules</a>
		that include some new rules,
		plus some clarification of other rules that seem ambiguous.</p>
      <hr><p>The layouts shown below were created using <i>almost</i> only the cards 
        hexes and supplies that came with <i>Settlers</i>, <i>Seafarers</i> and 
        <i>Cities & Knights</i>, and the associated 5-6 player expansion packs. 
        I did cheat a bit and added an extra one of each resource type, and an 
        extra couple of gold field cards. I created the extra cards by using a 
        colour copier and heavy paper stock, and then used double sided tape to 
        attach the newly printed hexes to the 2 (or was it three) hex blanks, 
        and to plain sea hexes (which seemed to be in a surplus quantity). I also 
        created an extra set of the 2-for-1 sea hex ports using the same method.</p>

      <a href="catan%20game%201.html"> <img src="images/catan%20game%201%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
      </a> <b>1. Basic Layout</b> - This layout can be used for basic <i>Settlers 
      of Catan</i> or <i>Cities & Knights</i>. It is not used with <i>Seafarers 
      of Catan</i>. The resource hexes are arranged in random sequence making 
      a large land hex, with some desert hexes in the middle. Note that gold field 
      hexes are used as well. This is a great layout to introduce new players 
      to Catan, playing the <i>Settlers</i> rules only. It also plays well for 
      introducing the novice player to <i>Cities & Knights</i>. <br  clear="left">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a href="catan%20game%202.html"> <img src="images/catan%20game%202%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
      </a> <b>2. Depleted Islands</b> - This layout is used with <i>Seafarers</i> 
      and <i>Cities & Knights</i>. It also optionally uses the special <i>Fishermen 
      of Catan </i>addon. The islands are called "depleted", because each of the 
      islands is missing one resource. Only wheat fields are found on every island. 
      This makes it critical to get a gold hex or a 2-for-1 port, or to split 
      your settlements over two islands. There are also two "mini" islands to 
      assist connecting the major islands. <br  clear="left">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a href="catan%20game%203.html"> <img src="images/catan%20game%203%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
      </a> <b>3. Two Continents</b> - This layout features two similar continents 
      separated by 2 sea hexes. In order to encourage sea routes, the first player 
      to connect the two continents receives 2 VPs, while remaining players receive 
      1 VP for connecting. Each player only collects for their first connection. 
      This layout can be played using Seafarers only, but is more fun with <i>Cities 
      & Knights</i> as well. It is a fairly simple layout, so is good for beginners. 
      <br  clear="left">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a href="catan%20game%204.html"> <img src="images/catan%20game%204%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
      </a> <b>4. Monolithic Islands</b> - This layout is the ultimate strategy game. 
      There are 5 islands, each one having only one resource type. To compensate 
      for the inevitable surplus of one or two resource types, the gold hexes 
      and 2-for-1 ports have been strategically placed. Also, the "inter-turn" 
      building phase has been adjusted to allow "bank trading". These features 
      help to ease the resource shortages and excesses, but inter-player trading 
      is also very important in this game. This layout requires <i>Seafarers</i>, 
      and plays well with <i>Cities & Knights</i>. Not for the timid! <br  clear="left">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a href="catan%20game%205.html"> <img src="images/catan%20game%205%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10"> 
      </a> <b>5. Climatic / Geological Zones</b> - This layout is the same idea 
      as <i>Monolithic Islands</i>, but doesn't require <i>Seafarers</i> and is 
      easier to get multiple resource types. The layout concept is a land mass 
      that has a mountainous region (with a gold bearing area), a hilly region, 
      a strip of forest, and then separate areas of fields and pastures. Optionally, 
      there is a coastline rich in fisheries. In some ways this is more realistic 
      than the random hex placement in the basic game. <br  clear="left">
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <a href="catan%20game%206.html"> <img src="images/catan%20game%206%20web%20small.jpg" align="left" border="0" hspace="10" width="300" height="225"> 
      </a> <b>6. The Rivers of Catan</b> - This layout contains two major continents, 
      each with a set of river hexes. Stick close to these hexes and you'll earn 
      some extra victory points. additional points can be earned by connecting 
      East and West. Either cross the middle ocean or use the outlying islands 
      as stepping stones. Note, this layout uses 
      the new <i>Rivers of Catan</i> from the <i>Traders & Barbarians</i> expansion 
      pack.<br  clear="left">

      </a> <b>7. Treasure Islands</b> - This layout features a resource poor central 
      starting island surrounded by 4 very rich <i>treasure</i> islands. Players 
      start on the central island and then attempt to acquire some of the riches 
      of the islands. Two of the islands are rich in gold fields, while the other 
      two islands are a fisherman's paradise. The first few rounds will be a struggle 
      for resources, but once the islands are breached, look out!<br  clear="left">
