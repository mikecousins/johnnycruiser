        <h3>Day 1, 2 (May 21, 22) - Flight to Athens</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_00.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      <p>Although there were 21 people in our group, only 17 of us were flying
	  together. One couple was spending a couple of "pre-trip" days in Rome, 
	  and another couple were using air points on a different flight. 
	  We were flying to Frankfurt 
        (9 hours) and then on to Athens (3 hours). Because of the distance ,
        we would arrive in Athens on the next day. We met at the Calgary airport 
		at 11:30 AM. We were delayed a bit for takeoff and finally left just
		before 2 PM. The Frankfurt flight 
        was long! They fed us 2 times on the flight so we certainly didn't go 
        hungry. Our group of 17 was randomly distributed in the middle of
		the aircraft, but I think all the couples were sitting together. The plane was 
		an A330 so we had two aisles in which to do laps.
		We arrived in Frankfurt pretty much on schedule and had a 2.5 hour
		wait for the next leg to Athens. The second leg seemed much faster being
		only about 2.5 hours in the air.
		<br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_01.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      Arriving at the Athens airport, our first problem was that the tour company 
        (<i>Hermes in Greece</i>)  was not aware of an earlier flight time change, so 
		there was no bus to pick us up. We ended up taking taxis to our hotel - the 
		Amalia Hotel in central Athens. The hotel was very nice and located just a couple 
		of blocks from the Plaka area. We could walk to all the historical sites.</p>
		
      <p>After checking in and refreshing ourselves, we did an orientation walk 
        around the area. Right next to the hotel was Syntagma Square. There we
      stopped in front of the Parliament Building and saw the "evzone" guards at 
	  attention. Just behind was the Presidential Palace, built in 1878.
	  Then we headed into a huge park area (the National Gardens)
	  with lots of shady trees. The park was established in 1840 and was
	  originally called the Royal Gardens. In the center of the park was a small zoo
	  but most of the animals seemed to be cats and dogs.
	  <br clear=right>
        <img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_02.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      <p>Leaving the park, we emerged across from the Kallimarmaro
	  Stadium that was (re)built for the 1896 olympic games. The stadium is
	  built on the exact site of the Panathenaic Stadium built by Lykourgos
	  in 330 bce. Continuing the walk
	  we passed the Temple of Zeus and Hadrian's Gate (to be visited on 
	  another day) and then 
	  rounded the bottom of the park to an excavation of a Roman bath site.
	  This site was discovered while digging a ventilation tunnel for the Athens
	  Metro. The baths had been built in the time of Hadrian, in the 3rd century ce.
	  We spent some time examining the site and
	  then it was back to the hotel  to get ready for dinner. During our walk we noticed
	  many homeless dogs and cats wandering around. They were well fed, so
	  somebody must be looking after them. 
        <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_03.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      After cleaning up in the hotel, we headed out for dinner in the Plaka area. 
	  The restaurant (I think it was called the Plaka Tavern) had a large sidewalk section
	  as most of the restaurants seemed to have. Our meal was very good. The
	  dinner was included as part of our trip package. However the staff 
	  tried to rip us off by overbilling us by about Euro 200. When our leader  (John) discovered
	  this, the staff  made some lame excuses to justify the bill amount. But
	  John stuck to his guns and the amount was corrected. Gotta watch out here!</p>
	  <p>After dinner, we had some time to walk around the Plaka and check out the souvenir 
	  shops before heading back to the hotel for the night.  The other 2 couples had 
	  arrived at the hotel, so we now had our full contingent of 21 people.
	  <br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 3 (May 23) - First full day in Athens</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_04.jpg" align="left" border="0">
      Changing time zones is always difficult for us. Although we were tired, 
	  we both woke up around 4:00 AM. I headed to the internet terminal in the lobby 
	  to write to the folks back home and let them know we had arrived safely. Eventually
	  it was 6:30 so we could do the breakfast buffet. The hotel put out a really good spread
	  for breakfast each morning - cereal, bread, toast, fried and scrambled eggs, sausages,
	  bacon, yoghurt, tomatoes, cucumber, sliced meats, cheese, cut up fruits and melons,
	  fruit juices, etc. It was great! We usually hit the buffet at 6:30, as soon as the restaurant 
	  opened.</p>
	  <p>After breakfast we all gathered at 9:00 for our walk to the Acropolis. We met our 
	  guide Vicki, who was to spend the next few days with us in Athens and Delphi. We set out from
	  the hotel walking down to Hadrian's arch, and then turning west along the edge of the Plaka. 
	  We passed the Theatre of Dionysos (we would visit this later) and the new Acropolis
	  Museum (opening later this year, all going well). Along the middle of the roadway workmen were 
	  erecting a long covered structure that would be used by booksellers for an upcoming 
	  book fair. The structure went on for 200 or 300 meters. Rounding the south end of the
	  Acropolis we passed the Theatre of Herodes Atticus and headed up the path to the
	  modern day ticket entrance to the Acropolis. There were lots of tourists everywhere.
		<br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_05.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      After  entering the park, the pathway took us to an overlook down into the Theatre of 
	  Herodes Atticus, built in 174 ce in memory of his wife. This is where "Yanni - Live 
	  at the Acropolis" was
	  filmed. Apparently a lot of outdoor concerts are performed there each year. The original
	  theatre had a cedarwood roof that improved the accoustics and made it weatherproof, 
	  but today it is open to the sky.</p>
	  <p>We then walked through the Beule Gate and up to the Propylaia, the ancient 
	  entrance to the Acropolis. To the right, in front of the Propylaia, was the small
	  Temple of Athena Nike built in 421 bce. The Propylaia was 
	  constructed in 432 bce as the "new" entrance to the Acropolis. There was much
	  restoration work going on and the structure was shrouded with metal scaffolding.
	  It was built on quite a slope, so there are many steps to walk up. The Propylaia
	  has been used for many things during its history and has suffered much damage
	  through accident, war and lightening.
		<br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_06.jpg" align="left" border="0">
      Then we walked over to the Erechtheion and stopped at the famous olive tree. This 
	  tree is planted where Athena first planted her olive tree in a competition against 
	  Poseidon. Vicki explained the lineage of the current olive tree, but I have somehow
	  managed to forget  the details. There was a girl working on restoring the marble 
	  stones of the Erechtheion, immediately behind the tree.</p>
	  <p>The Erechtheion was built in 406 bce and is located on the most sacred site
	  of the Acropolis, that being where the competition between Athena and Posiedon 
	  took place. It was named after Erechtheus, a mythical king of Athens. It is notable for
	  the famous caryatid columns in the shape of women. Inside was housed an olive wood 
	  statue of Athena (now gone). The building has had a range of uses over the centuries
	  with much damage and restoration occuring along the way.
	  <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_07.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
        Finally, we walked over to the most famous of all remains - the Parthenon. 
        Once again restoration work was in progress and scaffolding was everywhere. 
        The Parthenon was built in 438 bce and originally housed a 12 meter statue 
        of Athena Parthenos. As with the other ancient buildings, it has seen 
        many uses and damage over the centuries.</p>
	  <p>All done with the Parthenon, we left along the north edge of the base of the
	  Acropolis  returning to the Plaka. There we had lunch together at  a sidewalk cafe.
	  Then it was "on your own" time for  the rest of the afternoon, dinner and the evening.
	  At lunch it was announced that  we would be having a gift exchange at the end of the 
	  trip, so Marj and I spent the afternoon shopping for gifts. All of the souvenir shops
	  seemed to carry exactly the same stuff, but the prices really varied from shop
	  to shop. For dinner, neither of us were 
	  very hungry, so we satisfied ourselves with gelato. I can't remember doing anything
	  spectacular that evening - I think we just wandered around the Plaka, then headed
	  back to the hotel to read and get an early sleep.

        <h3>Day 4 (May 24) - Second full day in Athens, Sounion</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_08.jpg" align="left" border="0">
		We're still not  synchronized with the time in Greece, so I was up at 3:30 AM
		writing an email to the family. Shouldn't have gone to bed so early last night!
		Our hotel had a rooftop area on the 7th floor. It was in the process of being renovated, 
		perhaps for a restaurant. The view was wonderful from the roof and you could see 
		almost 360 degrees. The view of the Acropolis was excellent. This morning, we headed 
		up early to the rooftop to see the sunrise on the Acropolis. The angle was perfect as the 
		rising sun was behind us when facing the Acropolis. I got some good photos of
		the hill and the buildings upon it. A soft red light.</p>
		<p>After breakfast we met in the lobby to catch the bus to the National Archaeological
		Museum. The drive to the museum was interesting as we snaked through narrow 
		downtown streets. Along the way we passed several noteable buildings, including
		universities and museums. I've forgotten what they were.
       <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_09.jpg" align="right" border="0">
       The National Archaeological Museum was amazing, The first area we visited was 
	   a collection from Mycenes and Tiryns. The mask of Agamemnon was superb.
	   We had not yet been to the actual sites of Mycenea and Tiryns yet, but it was an 
	   interesting introduction to the excavations that we would be visiting later on in the trip.
	   Then we visited galleries that featured vases, sculptures and other artifacts from 
	   ancient Greece. We also toured a collection of treasures from the Cycladic islands.
	   What a great museum. We didn't have time for the other areas of the museum, such 
	   as the Egyption collection. The bookstore / gift shop had numerous interesting 
	   things you could buy. Fortunately I resisted.</p>
 	   <p>After we exited the museum, we boarded the bus for the Museum of Cycladic Art.
	   This museum opened in 1986 and is located in what used to be the home of Otto and 
	   Athina Stathatos . It was much smaller than the National Archaeological Museum,
	   but had an amazing collection of the unique Cycladic figurines. I really enjoyed
	   this museum as well. Then it was back on the bus and back to the hotel.
		<br clear=right>
       <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_10.jpg" align="left" border="0">
		We arrived at the hotel around 2:00 for lunch and the afternoon "on our own". Most
		of us hung out around the Plaka area, but one couple hopped on the train and
		had lunch and the afternoon in Piraeus. We weren't too
		hungry  so walked to a bakery bordering Syntagma Square and bought 
		some pre-made sandwiches and some chocolate milk. We ate these back 
		at the hotel. John had arranged an optional walking tour so we joined the group 
		at 3:00 in the lobby and headed out. We stopped first at the Temple of 
		Olympian Zeus. We walked around the site looking at the enormous columns.
		The temple is the largest in Greece. Construction started in the 6th century bce 
		and was completed some 650 years later. Only 15 of the original 104 columns 
		remain.</p>
		<p>Then we walked over to Hadrian's Gate. This was constructed during the
		reign of the emperor Hadrian (131 ce) and was a gift to the city.It was
		positioned to mark the boundary between the ancient city and the new Athens
		of Hadrian. Finally, we walked to the Theatre of Dionysos. It was (re)built in
		326 bce, but then enlarged later by the romans. It was the first theatre to be 
		built of stone.</p>
		<p>When we arrived back at the hotel, we heard the news that one of the ladies
		had had her purse stolen while sitting at an outdoor restaurant in the Plaka. 
		What a hassle she had 
		to go through to replace her passport, credit cards, etc. I think she spent a good 
		part of two days at the consulate obtaining the new documentation.

       At the hotel, we regrouped at 6:00 to take the bus to Cape Sounion 
	   to see the temple of Poseidon. The trip south was very interesting, hugging the 
	   coastline. We arrived at the site and parked at the entrance to the site, by a 
	   large restaurant., We bought tickets and hiked up to the temple.
	   Along the way we saw a Rock Partridge, common in the Cape Sounion area.
	   The temple was amazing, with no restorative scaffolding! The temple was
	   built in 444 bce.</p>
	   <p>Around 8:00, we returned to the bus and headed off to a restaurant for 
	   dinner. We had gone about 15 minutes along a narrow road, when the guide
	   realized that the restaurant we were booked for was the one at the temple!
	   We had to continue on for quite a distance before there was a place where 
	   the bus could turn around. And, of course, we ended up back where we
	   had originally been parked, but 45 minutes later!
	   We had a very nice dinner at the temple. As it got
	   dark, lights lit up the temple above us, like it was floating in the air. What a
	   beautiful evening. We then drove back along the coast in the dark, with the
	   lights of the houses twinkling along the road. We arrived back at the hotel 
	   at 11:00 and headed to bed.

        <h3>Day 5 (May 25) - An outing to Delphi</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_12.jpg" align="left" border="0">
        Up early again today and the usual great breakfast. We had to meet in the lobby
		at 8:30 to board the bus bound for the ancient city of Delphi. It was going to be 
		another hot day. It was about a 2.5 hour drive through the country.  Part way 
		through the trip we stopped for a bathroom break at a truck stop. There was
		the usual snack bar / restaurant / gift shop complex. We wandered through the
		shop looking for some snacks, as our lunch was going to be quite late. 
		It is always interesting
		to look at packaged snacks in another country.</p>
		<p> Just before reaching Delphi, as we wound along the side of a mountain,
		we passed through the "alpine" village of 
		Arachova. This is a very new ski village servicing the nearby Mount 
		Parnassus ski facility. The major industry seems to be selling carpets
		and furs.The bus twisted through the very narrow streets. What
		a great view of the surrounding valleys. At about 11:00 we 
		finally reached ancient Delphi.
        <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_13.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
        We purchased entrance passes and headed up the Sacred Way path.The first 
        area we passed through was the treasuries. These buildings held the offerings 
        of people from different cities. The best preserved building was the Athenian 
        Treasury. It was built around 490 bce, soon after the Battle of Marathon. 
        Then we travelled further up the Sacred Way to the Temple of Apollo. This 
        is the temple where the famed oracles lived. According to an article in 
        <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=0009BD34-398C-1F0A-97AE80A84189EEDF"
		target=_blank>Scientific American</a>, there were volcanic fault lines 
        directly below the temple leaking ethylene gas. This gas creates a trance-like 
        state which could explain the behaviour of the <i>Pythia</i>. 
		The structure remaing today dates from the 4th century bce. Some reconstruction 
		has been done in recent years.
		<br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_14.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
		Continuing up the path we came to the remains of a theatre, with seating 
		for about 5,000 people. It dated to the 5th century bce. This was the limit 
		of the guided tour portion of  our exploration of Delphi. Most of us 
		continued up the mountainside to the site of the stadium.</p>
		<p>The stadium is almost 200 meters long and is the site where the Pythian 
		Games were held every 4 years starting in 582 bce. The rows of seating 
		along the edges held about 7,000 people. The prizes to the winners of the
		events were purely honorary, receiving laurel wreaths and the right to have 
		a statue in the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>Finally we wound our way back down to the park entrance to visit the 
        Museum of Delphi. The museum was very interesting with many statues and 
        artifacts from the site. The most notable statue was that of "The bronze 
        <i>Charioteer</i>", commemorating a chariot victory in the Pythian
		Games of 478 bce. We also saw the famous "navel" stone, and a large mosaic
		floor reconstruction.

      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_15.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
		Benig almost 3:00, we loaded back into the bus to head back for lunch. On 
		the lower side of the highway was the Sanctuary of Athina, but we didn't stop
		there. We stopped in the village of Arachova at a wonderful restaurant 
		overlooking the valley below. As in most restaurants, the waiters were smoking.
		Not used to that any more! We were served chicken and pasta which was
		very good.</p>
		<p>We arrived back at the hotel around 6:30 and had the rest of the evening 
		to ourselves. Because we had such a late lunch, we just had gelato and a beer
		for dinner. After dark we headed up to the hotel rooftop to take pictures of
		the Acropolis lit up in the dark. It was really beautiful, but needless to say my
		photos didn't come out that well. Time for bed.

        <h3>Day 6 (May 26) - Athens wrapup and off to Pireas</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_16.jpg" align="left" border="0">
       Today was to be a busy day touring a number of Athenian sites before heading off
	   to Piraeus and the ship. We breakfasted at the usual 6:30 time. Our luggage
	   had to be out in the lobby by 8:45 for storing in the hotel's storage room.
	   We joined the group in the lobby 
	   at 9:00 for the walking tour. We headed off in the direction of the Plateia
	   Monastiraki. As we entered the district, we passed the Panagia Gorgoepikos
	   Church. It was built in the 12th century. It has beautiful carvings inside, but we 
	   didn't enter the church.</p>
	   <p>Further on, we came to the excavation site containing Hadrian's Library.
	   The library was built in 132 ce and included a garden with a pool.  A couple of 
	   blocks away we came to the site of the Tower of the Winds.  This site was 
	   once part of the larger Agora. The tower was originally a water clock and 
	   weather vane, built by the Syrian astronomer
	   Andronikos Kyrrestes in the 2nd century bce. it is an octagonal structure, with 
	   mythical beings carved on each side representing the 8 winds (N, NW, W, SW, 
	   S, SE, E and NE). Nearby were the ruins of the public latrines, which prompted
	   John to lecture us graphically on the status of Roman hygiene. Across the open
	   field of the site was a Turkish Mosque (the Fethiye Mosque) . It was built in the
	   15th century to commemorate Mehmet the Conqueror's visit to Athens.
        <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_18.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  Then we walked a short distance onto the grounds of the main area of the ancient 
	  Agora. This is a large area containing many ruins, some dating as far back 
	  as the 6th century bce. We entered the Agora from the Northwest corner and 
	  immediately encountered the alter of the twelve gods and the double row of statues.
	  We also encountered a (headless) statue of the Emperor Hadrian.
	  From there we turned up the path to a large temple, the Hephaisteion (also known
	  as the Theseion). This temple was fairly complete and was built in 440 bce. 
	  On one side of the temple was a large grassy field, and two small tortoises
	  were ambling along on the grass. (I say small, because they were nothing like 
	  the 500 pounders I had seen in the Galapagos). </p>
	  <p>Coming back down from the temple hill, we encountered the Monument 
	  of the Eponymous Heroes. This is a long stone structure upon which sat 
	  the bronze statues
	  of the ten "heroes" who represented the ten tribes of Athens. The structure was
	  also used as a public notice board where proposed legislation, decrees and 
	  announcements were posted. 
		<br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_19.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	   Then we headed across the site to the Stoa of Attalos. This huge building had 
	   been reconstructed in 1956 thanks to a large donation by John D Rockefeller Jr. 
	   It is the most complete building on the site. On the steps were a few young girls 
	   painting scenes of the Agora. I guess it was an art class. We also encountered
	   several homeless dogs who seemed quite content. The stoa was very interesting.
	   In the middle of the stoa was a small museum with artifacts from the site. Of
	   special interested were fragments of pottery with names scratched on them that
	   were used to vote people into exile (an early version of Survivor). Along
	   the length of the open corridor were statues of various noteables.</p>
	   <p>We recrossed the site to the Kerameikos, an ancient cemetery dating
	   back to the 12th century bce. There we saw some very old graves and 
	   some famous stelae such as the Stele of Demetria and Pamphile (4th century
	   bce). We found a shady area nearby and sat down while John read the address
	   given by Perikles to the Athenians honouring the fallen Athenian soldiers 
	   during the Peloponnesian War.
        <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_17.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	   We then walked some distance to the site of the ancient city walls and entrance 
	   gate. The walls were built in the 5th century bce by Themistocles (I suspect 
	   he had some help). The walls divided the city into an inner and outer part.
	   There were two gates - the one we saw was the Dipylon Gate.</p>
	   <p>Done with our exploring, it was about 1:00 so we headed back to the Plaka 
	   area for lunch and a short break on our own. Once again we just grabbed some 
	   gelato and wandered the Plaka. Then we met in the hotel lobby at 3:00 to transfer
	   our luggage to the bus and head to Piraeus. There was a bit of a holdup as one
	   of the ladies in our group took a wrong turn in the Plaka and ended up lost. She 
	   eventually found her way to the hotel and we headed off to Piraeus.</p>
	   <p>It was a short drive to Piraeus harbour - maybe 30 minutes or so. Along the
	   way we passed the football stadium where Olympiacos play. The bus rounded 
	   the harbour and let us off right by our ship - the Kapetan Antonis. At this point
	   I'll wrap up "Part 1" with a description of life aboard the ship.

        <h3>Random Ramblings #1 - Reflections on the <i>Kapetan Antonis</i></h3>

      This ship was a new experience for us. We didn't know what to expect, 
	  having never been on such a small ship
	  before. As it turned out, we had mixed feelings about the ship. The size of
	  the ship didn't bother us, but the accomodations were not the best.  Here is a 
	  summary of the ship, what we liked and what we didn't.</p>
	  <p>The <i>Kapetan Antonis</i> was built in 1979 and was refurbished in 2007. 
        It has a pine hull and is 99 feet (30 meters) long. It has 10 cabins (20 
        passengers) and carries 5 crew. The yacht is rented out through several 
        yacht management companies. Here is what we enjoyed aboard the ship: 
      <ul>
	  <li>On calm sailing days the upper deck was wonderful to watch the ocean and 
	  talk with friends.
	  <li>The cook did some fantastic meals for us, never repeating in 14 days. Breakfasts
	  were a bit monotonous, but the main meals were wonderful.
	  <li>To combat the lack of variety at  breakfast, Marj and I bought yoghurt and chocolate milk
	  from the local grocery stores. Monica was kind enough to let us share her fridge.
	  <li>The staff were very accomodating to the passengers. Some didn't speak English much, 
	  but that was OK.
	  <li>The captain went out of his way to assist setting up a laundry area on the foredeck.
	  <li>The public areas inside and on deck were kept clean and tidy.
	  <li>The swim stops were a great idea. Although Marj and I didn't partake, others seemed to 
	  have a wonderful time.
	  <li>Although I was unaware of what was happening behind the scenes, the captain seemed
	  to help in last minute arrangements for hailing buses and renting cars.
	  </ul>
      <p> <img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_22.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
        <img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_23.jpg" align="right" border="0"> <br clear=left>
        On the other hand, there were a number of things that were either disappointing or 
		below expectations: 
      <ul>
	  <li>The cabins were very small (ie. tiny closet with only one hanger) and smelled
	  of mould. Several people had at least one cockroach in their cabin.
	  <li>There was no shower stall in the bathroom, only a handheld shower head over the toilet.
	  <li>The cupboard area beneath my berth was wet (hence the smell?)
	  <li>The cabins were advertised as air conditioned - but the ductwork was tiny and did
	  not operate at night when the engines were off. Hence the cabins were very warm and 
	  humid overnight.
	  <li>Our porthole was next to the engine exhaust port, so opening it often yielded diesel odours.
	  <li> When the ship rolled (fortunately this
	  only happened on our first night), the cabin walls creaked 
	  very loudly (every 5 or 6 seconds) for most of the night.
	  <li>The walls had no sound insulation, so you could hear much of what was happening in 
	  neighbouring cabins - alarm clocks, toilets, running water, etc.
	  <li> People in other cabins reported quite a number of small problems, 
	  some of which were fixed.
	  <li>Not being coffee or tea drinkers (only milk, water , fruit juices or pop), we didn't
	  appreciate having to buy all drinks (other than orange juice at breakfast). Even water
	  was a la carte. I can understand charging for liquor, but not other drinks.
	  <li>The ladder used for swimming and accessing the zodiac was slippery. At least two 
	  people hurt themselves on it. The zodiac was difficult to get in and out of due to stays
	  crossing through the center of the craft.
	  </ul>
	  And then there was the infamous "Poseidon Adventure" day, when the captain should
	  have cancelled the sail for that day. It turned out to be very uncomfortable and 
	  physically dangerous. However, despite all these problems, we all managed to survive and actually
	  had a great time!

        <h3>Random Ramblings #2 - All I know about Greek beer</h3>
      </center>
      <p>

	  <br clear=left>
      My only experience with Greek beer prior to the trip was with Mythos which is available
	  at a local Calgary liquor store. It seemed to be the most popular beer in Greece, being
	  on the menu at every restaurant, prominent at the grocery stores and winning hands down 
	  in the sidewalk cafe sun umbrella contest. I was surprised to read that it is the second largest 
	  brewery in Greece. So what is the largest brewery? Athenian brewery. </p>
	  <p>The other beer that seemed popular was Alfa (or Alpha) beer. It was also readily
	  available in restaurants and grocery stores. On our little ship, the beer that was provided 
	  (ie. sold) was Amstel which is Dutch. It turns out that the Athenian Brewery is owned by 
	  Heineken and brews Alfa beer, Marathon Beer (among other beers),
	  and Amstel beer (under license from Amstel 
	  in Amsterdam). That's why the Amstel product was so prevalent in Greece.
