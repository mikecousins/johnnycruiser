        <h3>Day 6 (May 26) - Sailing to Aigina (Pop. 12,400)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_26.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  We arrived in Piraeus harbour about  4:00 PM, ready to board 
	  the Kapetan Antonis for our 
	  island adventure. The crew was there to meet us and we carried all of our
	  belongings aboard. Marj and I were assigned one of the bigger cabins,
	  but it was tiny just the same. We unloaded our bags and stored our clothes in the 
	  minimal space provided. We flipped a coin to see who got to use the hanger
	  in the closet. Then it was back up on deck for the sail away party. Whoops,
	  we had to wait for someone missing. It was the lady who had lost her handbag. 
	  She was still involved in last minute negotiations relative to either her
	  passpaort or credit cards.</p>
	  <p>Finally she arrived and we set off from the harbour. Whoops, we couldn't
	  get the anchor up. Turns out we were hooked on the anchor from another
	  yacht across the harbour. After much frustration, the crew finally freed the
	  anchor and, yes, we were really under way! It was 6:00 PM by this time.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_27.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	   We had a short sail across open water and arrived at the island of Aigina about 7:30. 
	   We docked on the east side of the island at a little village called
	   Agia Marina.  We had dinner about 8:00. Some of the people headed in to the
	   little town after dinner. Sleeping was a bit of a problem this night. The
	   ship was anchored in open water and it rocked side to side most of the night.
	   The rocking wasn't a concern, but the creaking of our cabin wall was extremely loud.
	   We also opened our porthole, and let in several mosquitos. It's funny though,
	   for the rest of the cruise we didn't have a creaking wall or mosquitos again.
	   Get all the problems over with on the first night!</p>
	   <p>The next morning we had what was to be our "standard" breakfast. A
	   plate of ham and cheese slices, one type of cereal, dry bread, fried
	   eggs and sausage or bacon, sliced apple 
	   and honeydew melon, and orange juice.  I really missed the variety of
	   milk, yoghurt, fresh vegetables, fruit, juices, etc that we had at the hotel.
	   Oh well, it was still good.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_28.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
		After breakfast (9:00) a bus picked us up for a tour across the island. First
		we headed up the hill to the Temple of Aphaia. The Doric temple dates 
		from 490 bce. We were the first tour group to arrive and it was nice to wander 
		the site without crowds of people. The columns were carved from a very 
		soft local limestone with lots of embedded shells. They were very eroded.
		It was an amazing site.</p>
		<p>We then travelled across the interior of the island stopping at the old
		village of Palaiochora. Populated since Byzantine times, it was destroyed
		by Barbarossa in 1537. The surrounding area was abandoned in 1856. We
		climbed up the mountainside examining the ruins, then returned to the bus.
		I notice that a lot of the islands have a village called Palaiochora, which
		means "Old Town". 
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_29.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
		We continued across the island arriving at Aigina Town by 11:00. This
		was a good sized town, much larger that
		Agia Marina. We wandered
		around the town on our own. I found a great smoothie shop - 
		the only really good one that we found
		on all the islands that we were to visit. Aigina is known for its pistachio nuts,
		and there were shops selling them everywhere. I think quite a number of people
		bought some for the cruise. As we wandered through the narrower streets, we
		came upon a large fish market. Lots of interesting fish there.
		We were back to the bus by 12:30 
		ready to travel back to Agia Marina. Once back we had time for a quick "lunch 
		on your own". We found a quiet little restaurant (we were the only customers) 
		and had a great Greek salad (and Mythos beer). The feta cheese was creamy, 
		with a consistency of cream cheese. It was great.</p>
		<p>Finally we boarded the ship at 2:00 and set sail for the island of Hydra.
		Aigina was a beautiful island and I would really like to see more of it.
		<br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 7 (May 27) -  Sailing to Hydra (Pop. 3,000)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_30.jpg" align="left" border="0">
      So, we left Aigina around 2:00 PM and headed for Hydra. It was quite a long
	  haul. We traveled along the mainland, passing the island of Poros along
	  the way. Our original itinerary said we were going to stop at Poros, but I guess 
	  the plan changed. After nearing the island of Hydra, we pulled in to a small bay for
	  a swim stop. I think this bay is called Mandraki. After an hour or so break, we
	  continued onwards. It was 4:00 and John started his first reading from
	  Homer's Odyssey, as we gathered on the upper deck. This was to become
	  a daily event. I guess it was also sleep time for some, but John
	  didn't seem to mind.</p>
	  <p>We arrived at Hydra Town about 6:30. We had a couple of hours
	  to walk around the island in the evening sun, as dinner was to be at 8:30.
	  We headed off with Lee and Lynn. The island is pedestrian only, so there
	  were no cars or motorbikes anywhere.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_31.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  Walking along the waterfront, we encountered a number of donkeys and mules 
	  carrying luggage up to some hotel. It seems like this is a common means of 
	  transport, judging from the number of donkeys we saw. The waterfront was 
	  lined with outdoor restaurants. A good place to eat and watch donkeys! 
	  We walked on around to the east side of the harbour where the old fort and 
	  canons were. As we walked into the fort area, a lady shouted out from
	  a balcony "You can't go there, it's private property" (or something like that).
	  We obediently turned around. The lady laughed and said "Not you, 
	  the sailboat". Sure enough a sailboat was trying to moor where it
	  shouldn't have been. So, we turned around again and climbed up to the 
	  canons and a great view of the harbour. The fort consisted of several
	  buildings, one of which had been transformed into a naval museum.
	  The museum was closed so we didn't go in. Directly across the harbour
	  was another military complex, which apparently is now a school of
	  fine arts.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_32.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  A high speed ferry arrived at the ferry dock and
	  we could see the donkeys heading over to carry luggage.  We were to see
	  many high speed "Vodafone" ferries (or  "Flying Dolphin" hydrofoils) during
	  our trip. They were very fast, averaging 30 minutes between neighbouring islands.</p>
	  <p>Lee spotted
	  some church spires up the hill that looked interesting. We decided 
	  to hike up the narrow streets and try to find the church. Once away from the 
	  waterfront, the streets (ie. paths) were narrow with high walls. It was difficult to 
	  know which way you were going other than up or down. Every so often we 
	  would come to an intersection guarded by a donkey or mule. After climbing
	  some serious stairs, we finally found the church. The sun was starting to set, 
	  so we headed back down to the waterfront.  What a wonderful little town!
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_33.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
        We were back onboard the <i>Kapetan Antonis</i> by 8:30 for dinner.
		Dinners were wonderful aboard. The cook had a minimal area for
		preparing the meals but did a fantastic job. He was cooking for 21 people, 
		and we never went hungry. I don't think that we ever finished everything he
		cooked - I imagine the crew got to finish it. I didn't keep track of what we had 
		each meal, but he never repeated the main course. We had several kinds
		of fish, spanikopita, moussaka, pastitsio, kleftes, souvlaki, calamari,
		octopus, beef, and many other dishes.</p>
		<p>Tonight the ship was in protected waters, so there was no creaking. It 
		was just very warm in the cabin. The next morning we were up early, seated
		on the upper deck. The harbour was beautiful in the morning sun. 
		Breakfast call was at 8:00. After breakfast we raised anchor and headed 
		for the island of Spetses.
		<br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 8 (May 28) - Sailing to Spetses (Pop. 3,700), Nafplio</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_34.jpg" align="left" border="0">
      It was a short trip to Spetses. We left Hydra about 9:00 AM, and arrived at
	  Spetses Town about 10:00. We had two hours to wander around before 
	  having to be back on the ship again. We had docked pretty well in the
	  center of the town, so decided to head towards the southern end of the harbour.
	  We walked past the "downtown" buildings and a small church and then along
	  the seawall lined with residences. After reaching a point of land, we rounded the 
	  corner onto another small marina. We decided we had gone far enough and 
	  turned around retracing our steps back to the ship. Still having some time, we 
	  explored the area nearby the ship. The sidewalks and patios were
	  decorated with white and black pebble patterns - much like you see in
	  Chinese gardens. Apparently Spetses is famous for these pebble
	  mosaics. We also checked out the statue of Bouboulina, the female 
	  admiral from the early 1800's.  Finally, we joined some others wandering 
	  a small strip of beach. A local fisherman was cleaning some small fish 
	  at the edge of the beach.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_35.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  We were back on the ship by 12:00 noon, and ready to leave for Nafplion.
	  Nafplion is not on an island, it is on the Peloponnese peninsula. So,
	  we were heading back to the mainland for a couple of days.
	  It was quite a distance to Nafplion. We would be sailing up the coast of the
	  mainland. After about an hour of sailing, we stopped at a small bay for a 
	  swim break. This must have been on the peninsula. After the swimmers
	  were back on board again, we continued up the coastline. Lunch was served 
	  about 2:00. The seas were very calm, so it was no problem serving and
	  eating lunch while under power. At 4:00, John did another reading to us
	  from the Odyssey. Once again everyone was attentive, but some were 
	  concentrating with their eyes closed. The upper deck was perfect for
	  lounging around, or listening to the readings. It was half covered with a
	  large blue tarpaulin which allowed people to sit in the shade or in the
	  sun. I found the sun to be quite hot sometimes.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_36.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  We arrived at Nafplion Harbour around 5:00. Nafplion is an interesting city.
	  From 1829 until 1834, Nafplion was the first capital of newly liberated
	  Greece (from the Turks). The first king of Greece (King Otto, I think) moved
	  the capital to Athens in 1834. The importance of Nafplion to both the Turks and 
	  the Venetians over the centuries resulted in fortifications being built in the
	  harbour and up the surrounding hills. From the ship we could see the 
	  Palamidi fortress up on the hill, and the fortress on the island of Bourtzi,
	  right in the middle of the harbour. The island fortress was most recently
	  a luxury hotel (now closed). So, into this historic harbour we sailed,
	  approached our berth, when something happened. We turned around and
	  sailed out of the harbour again. This was accompanied by much shouting
	  between the crew, to the point where I thought they were going to kill
	  each other. Apparently, though, this is just how Greek is spoken. It 
	  turned out that a transmission pin had sheared off and the ship couldn't 
	  go into reverse. Outside of the harbour, repairs were made and we once 
	  again triumphantly sailed into the harbour. It was 6:30 when we
	  finally docked.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_37.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  The remainder of the day was "dinner and evening on your own". After such
	  a big (and late) lunch on the ship, neither of us was too hungry, so we stopped
	  at a gelato shop for a snack.  We wandered around the town center. The main
	  streets were regular pavement, but the smaller streets and
	  walkways were paved with marble blocks. We found
	  a large plaza (Plateia Syntagmatos)
	  that was surrounded by souvenir shops, restaurants and a large
	  church. Kids were playing soccer using two statues as goal posts.
	  Marj bought some coasters at a small souvenir shop. They had pictures
	  of whitewashed buildings that looked like Santorini. We traversed a few
	  more narrow, bouganvillia lined streets, saw several interesting churches
	  (didn't go in them) and then headed back to the
	  ship for the night.

        <h3>Day 9 (May 29) - Exploring ancient Greece</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_38.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Today would be spent on the mainland visiting the historic sites of Mycenae,
	  Tiryns and Epidaurus. We had the regular breakfast at the regular time and
	  then boarded the bus for the adventure. As we boarded we met our guide
	  for the day, Tina. She was very knowledgeable and spoke very good English.
	  Our first stop was to be Mycenae,
	  which was about an hour's drive from Nafplion. The Greek countryside
	  was very interesting. It is a very hot, dry climate and the lanscape reminded
	  me of the Kamloops area. Lots of rolling hills, very few trees (mostly scrub), but
	  lots of low bushes. The overall colour is brown, with green shrubs contrasting
	  with the brown. Along the highway we saw a lot of yellow gorse. The
	  valleys are heavily irrigated with the main crops being olive trees, citrous
	  trees (oranges, lemons) and grapes. Like the Okanagan Valley, this gives
	  the illusion of a much lusher climate. A lot of the buildings seem to be under 
	  construction or deserted (I find it difficult to tell the difference). Also, it is quite common
	  for one or two story buildngs to have great clusters of rebar projecting up
	  from the roof. Apparently this makes the building "incomplete" which
	  has tax implications. At least that's what one of our group explained.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_39.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  We arrived at Mycenae about 10:00. It was very hot.
	  We bought our tickets and entered the site.
	  The first thing we saw was the "Lion Gate", dating to the 13th century bce. Then
	  we stopped at the grave circle. Following the Cyclopean walls, we encountered
	  the main part of the city and the royal palace. At the far end of the site we 
	  went down a flight of stairs into the earth where a cistern had been built. It was so nice
	  and cool down there! It was nice that we had done the Mycenae exhibit at the 
	  museum in Athens. Mycenae was the home of legendary Agememnon.</p>
	  <p>Leaving the site, we stopped at the gift shops near the entrance gate where they
	  sold freshly squeezed orange juice. Marj had a large glass and really enjoyed it.
	  We walked back to the bus for a short ride to the tombs of Mycenae.
	  Here we visited the most complete tomb, called the Treasury of Atreus.
	  It was a huge underground beehive shaped building, made out of huge
	  blocks of stone. The tomb is now empty (except that we
	  were in it), but it was still an amazing structure.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_40.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  Then it was on to the bus and off to Tiryns. The Tiryns site was more in ruins than
	  Mycenae. Only the Cyclopean walls were still intact. It was very hot there with no shade.
	  We wandered through the site looking at the foundations of ancient buildings. 
	  Tiryns was built on a hill, so the site provide great views of the surrounding valleys.
	  We could see the orchards of olive trees, and, in the distance, the port of
	  Nafplion.</p>
	  <p>Then it was back in the bus and off to lunch. At 2:00 we stopped at a restaurant 
	  in a small village near Epidaurus. I think the village was Ligourio. It was
	  "lunch on your own". We sat with Keith and Carrie and had mousaka (I think).
	  Back on the bus, we arrived at Epidaurus at 3:30. Entering the
	  site we first encountered the huge theatre, built in the 4th century bce. It was
	  remarkably intact. The accoustics were amazing. There was a spot in the
	  center of the stage area that provided a perfect sound reflection focal point.
	  Even speaking in a normal voice, one could hear the immediate
	  reflection. Wow! The theatre is still used for outdoor productions.
		<br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_41.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  Then we walked on to the remains of the religious center. There
	  was a lot of reconstruction going on, including repair and raising of 
	  fallen stone pillars. We also saw the remains of a stadium. This was used
	  every 4 years for the festival in honour of Asklepios. It was still very hot
	  out so I think most of us had pretty well had it for the day. Fortunately it
	  was time to head out again on the air conditioned bus.</p>
	  <p>At this point we headed south to the village of Portoheli. Our ship had 
	  moved to this new location while we were exploring ancient Greece. The
	  port was a 2 hour sail south of Nafplion, so we would gain those 2 hours tomorrow
	  morning when we would set sail for Sifnos. We reboarded the ship around
	  6:00. We had time for a quick walk around the town. It was a beautiful little
	  port town. The harbour was full of colourful fishing boats, and there was
	  a large white church along the waterfront. 
	  John did a reading from
	  the Odyssey at 7:00 and then we were called to dinner
	  about 8:30. It was pastitsio tonight! After dinner we did a quick walk
	  along the sea wall and then to bed.

        <h3>Day 10 (May 30) - Sailing to Serifos (Pop. 1,100)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_42.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Today we were leaving Portoheli heading for Sifnos. It was to be our
	  longest open water sailing of the trip - about 8 or 9 hours. Fortunately we
	   had bused down to Portoheli yesterday, or we would have had 2 more hours of
	   sailing. The captain had promised an early start, and, sure enough, the
	   engines fired up at 4:55 AM. Our voyage started our with fairly calm seas,
	   and gave no warning that this was to become our "day from hell". We got 
	   up shortly after and headed to the upper deck. It was starting to get a bit 
	   rough and the ship was rocking a bit. By the time that  our normal
	   breakfast time rolled around (so to speak), it was rough enough that
	   breakfast had been cancelled. </p>
	   <p>Our direction of sailing took us across the wind, so we were parallel to the
	   waves. This made the side-to-side rolling very pronounced. A number of people
	   were curled up in various places around the ship, clutching plastic shopping bags.
	   I don't think they had been shopping! I felt sorry for the group, but there
	   was nothing that could be done.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_43.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  The rough seas continued throughout the day. In the kitchen and dining areas, things were not
	  properly battened down, and china and glasses were being thrown around and breaking.
	  A number of us stayed up
	  on the top deck, while others found "safe havens" elsewhere. Marjorie decided
	  to stay lying down in our cabin below. The time passed really, really slowly.
	  I had done a lot of sailing in English Bay (Vancouver) in my youth, 
	  including once or twice 
	  where it was so rough that we tied ourselves to the cockpit. The bouncing around
	  had never bothered me. However, seeing the effects on the other passengers
	  was very disturbing, and it really was dangerous to walk around.
	  By noon, I decided to head down below and check up on Marjorie. It was
	  very difficult to walk across the deck and then go down the ladder. When
	  I made it to our cabin. Marjorie seemed OK. I lay down as well and closed my eyes.
	  I guess I was tired from not sleeping so well since we arrived in Greece, and 
	  immediately fell asleep. I woke up a bit later and the boat was thrashing quite violently.
	  I later found out that the folks trapped on the upper deck were being thrown about.
	  Two people were tossed right out of their chairs, and some of the chairs had broken.
	  There was nothing they could do as it was impossible to cross the deck and 
	  do the ladder. Down below, unaware of what was happening above, I went back
	  to sleep. 
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_44.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  When I woke up again, it was strangely calm. Looking out the porthole, we 
	  were near an island. I went up above and it turned out that the winds and seas 
	  hadn't abated, but we had sailed into the lee of the island and were quite protected.
	  During the course of the day the captain had changed our itinerary, heading to
	  Serifos rather than Sifnos, saving an extra hour of agony. In retrospect, I think that if 
	  the captain had realized how bad it was going to be, he would not have sailed at all 
	  that day. Considering the damage done to the ship (dishware broken, chairs broken, 
	  a metal mainstay snapped, etc) and the threat of injury to the passengers, I'm
	  sure the decision would have been to wait a day.</p>
	  
    <p>Anyway, here we were in beautiful Serifos, and it was time for lunch (2:00 
      PM). It was amazing how quickly people seemed to recover. The cook whipped 
      up a batch of delicious spaghetti, which disappeared quite quickly. But 
      then, we hadn't had breakfast! We were given the afternoon "on our own". 
      We walked into the little town and browsed the shops. Paul and I walked 
      to the base of the Chora, planning to walk up for the view, but as it was 
      stinking hot, we decided not to. A transit bus went by us, but wouldn't 
      stop. <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_45.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      We headed back to the dock area and watched a huge high speed ferry
	  pull up to the dock.  It was packed with people and vehicles. The foot passengers
	  swarmed off of the ferry, some meeting greeters on the dock. The vehicular
	  traffic threaded through the flocking passengers, as there was no attempt
	  to segregate pedestrians from vehicles. Three small trucks were loaded with 
	  large terra cotta pots, furniture, and other items for tomorrow's flea market.</p>
	  <p>We were back on the ship at 7:00 PM for another reading from the Odyssey.
	  I think Odysseus would have been proud of our group and how we 
	  battled the worst that Poseidon could throw at us and won.
	  People seemed no worse for wear, and we headed down for dinner at 8:00. 
	  It had been an eventful day, one that wouldn't soon be forgotten. We 
	  did a short walk about on the dock and then headed off to bed.

        <h3>Day 11 (May 31) - Sailing to Sifnos (Pop. 1,950), Folegandros (Pop. 650)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_46.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Today would be a two island day. We were headed to Sikinos and would stop
	  for the afternoon in Sifnos. I got up early and headed up to the upper deck to 
	  join the other early risers. The call to breakfast was at 8:00.  We had the
	  usual for breakfast. At 9:00 the engines fired up and we were underway
	  to Sifnos. </p>
	  <p>Back up on the upper deck, Serifos was behind us and we could see
	  Sifnos in the distance. The Cycladic islands are fairly close together and,
	  for most of our travels, we could see the island that we were sailing to as soon
	  as we left the previous island. Only a couple of times were we surrounded 
	  by open water with no land in sight. It was interesting when several islands
	  were in view and people had their maps out trying to identify which island
	  was which.</p>
	  <p>We arrived at the island of Sifnos about noon. We stopped in a small bay
	  for a swim (perhaps Vourlidia Bay?). A couple of impressive yachts entered the
	  bay while we were there, and anchored nearby.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_47.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  After the swim, we were ready to sail on to Kamares for lunch. However,
	  the captain decided to take the opportunity to try to fix the leak that was dripping
	  on someone's bed. It was related to the air conditioner or the engine, I
	  never did hear which. It took about 1.5 hours of tinkering and I'm not sure if
	  that fixed the leak or just moved it. It seemed to be an unusual decision to 
	  spend the time floating in the bay rather than fixing the problem during our lunch
	  stop in Kamares. Oh well, there must have been a reason.</p>
	  <p>After a short sail we arrived in the port of Kamares. It was a small village 
	  with a single main street. There was no Chora visible above in the hills. We
	  wandered around for a while checking out the restaurants and then settled
	  on one that served crepes. I had a delicious ham, cheese and vegetable 
	  crepe that was very good (with a Mythos beer, of course). Marj had a crepe
	  and a sorbet, and I think Paul had a crepe as well. Robin and Fred came
	  along and joined us at a neighbouring table and they had gelatos.
	  It was a beautiful little island and we really enjoyed our stop over.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_48.jpg" align="left" border="0"> At 
        4:00, we boarded the <i>Kapetan Antonis</i> ready to travel to Sikinos. 
		However, at some point in the afternoon, the captain suggested that Folegandros
		would be a much nicer island to visit. So, Sikinos was scratched from the
		itinerary and Folegandros was added. It was about a 2 hour trip and we
		docked at  Karavostasi, a small marina village, at about 6:00 PM. Tonight
		was to be a BBQ, and the time was set for 10:00 PM (or so). We 
		wandered along the main street and came to a bus terminal. We had just missed
		the bus that went up to the Chora (called Folegandros Town). Then, out
		of nowhere, a bus came hurtling down the road. Four of us jumped on the bus
		ready to go to the Chora. However, the bus took us back to the ship. It
		turned out that the captain had called the bus to take the entire group up to
		the Chora. Everyone else climbed aboard and we were driven up to the Chora.
		It was some distance up a narrow winding road, so it must have taken about
		15 minutes or so. What a beautiful village. I can see why the captain diverted 
		us to Folegandros!
        <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_49.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  From where we were let off the bus, we could see a beautiful church way up on 
	  a hillside (called Koimisis tis Theotokou, 
	  you can see it in the accompanying photo above). There was a very nice 
	  switchback path so several of us headed up to the church. Along the way 
	  were wonderful views looking down the cliffs to the ocean below. We wandered 
	  around the church yard, but the church itself wasn't open. Then we headed back down the path
	  to the town. As we entered the town, we diverted through some narrow pathways that
	  were actually part of a beautiful hotel. It consisted of many one and two story
	  whitewashed buildings, some joined together. We stopped in at the lobby to pick up
	  a brochure. The rooms cost about $150.</p>
	  <p>It was getting dark by now and the village was bustling. The outdoor restaurants
	  were busy and there were lots of people milling about. It was a wonderful
	  warm evening, so we just wandered through the area. I envied the lifestyle
	  of the locals meeting for the evening outside in the sidewalk bars and
	  restaurants. What a life! Then it was 9:30 and time to meet the bus to go
	  back to the ship. As we approached the ship, there was billowing smoke,
	  so we knew the BBQ was not far off. We had lamb and I think another meat - 
	  maybe beef? It was very good. The leftover kabobs were thrown on the dock where
	  about 15 feral cats came out of the rockery and devoured the meat. Then
	  it was to bed.

        <h3>Day 12 (June 1) - Sailing to Thira (Santorini, Pop. 12,500)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_50.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Today we were travelling to Thira (or Santorini), the first place in Greece that we
	  had been to before (Oct 2006). It was a 4 hour trip and we had to be there by 9:00 
	  to meet our guide. So, we left Folegandros at 5:00 AM. I did my usual sailaway 
	  routine on the upper deck. Breakfast was at 8:00. There was no swim
	  stop on the way today. We arrived at Thira at about 9:00. We departed the ship
	  and walked along the waterfront to the base of the cable car list. There were
	  very few people there. so we got on right away. The ride up was less than 2 minutes
	  so we were soon all up at the top, in Fira town, We had to wait a bit for the guide
	  to show up. His name was Kostas, and he was a very good guide.</p>
	  <p>Our first activity was a walk to the edge of the village to the Archaeological
	  Museum. This museum housed all of the artifacts found at Akrotiri and
	  Ancient Thira. There were a lot of pottery remains and some wonderful wall 
	  mosaics and paintings (frescos). It was a great museum. We hadn't visited the
	  museum on our previous trip, so this was new to us.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_51.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	 After completing the museum, we headed down the street to the bus that was
	 waiting for us. From there we drove southeast to the black sand beach village 
	 of Kamari. The previous time we were here,
	 it was late October and the beach was deserted.
	 This time it was decorated with rows of beach umbrellas and lounge chairs.
	 From Kamari we were to head up the mountain on a narrow switchback road
	 to the site of Ancient Thira (we hadn't been there before
	 either). Due to the narrowness of the road, we had to 
	 swtich to a smaller 16 passenger bus. That meant that some of us had to
	 wait at the beach for the bus to return for a second load. One lady in our
	 group thought that the switchback would be to much for her, so she stayed
	 in Kamari. It was a good decision as the drive up was very slow
	 and pretty nerve racking.</p>
	 <p>At the top we joined the rest of the group and then hiked further up the hill
	 to the ruins. It was a very large town overlooking the ocean below. Some
	 of the ruins are from the 4th century bce, while other "newer" ruins are from
	 Hellenistic and Roman periods. 
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_52.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  We wandered around the ruins for over an hour. At one spot, looking down
	  the mountainside, was a large amphitheatre. It would have had a marvelous view.
	  Once again it was a very hot day and there was little shade on the site. When
	  we had completed the ruins, we headed back down the pathway to the
	  bus. This time we decided to pack all 21 people (including the guide) onto
	  the bus and do the trip down in one go. Some of us sat on the floor.
	  It was a hairy ride down, often not being
	  able to see any road beneath us. The bus had to go slowly because most of the
	  road was cobbled, and the switchback turns were extemely tight. We met a 
	  number of cars coming up, and that was fun negotiating passing.</p>
	  <p>At the bottom we rejoined our beach girl and piled into the large bus 
	  for the ride back to Fira.We arrived at Fira about 2:00 for lunch and the 
	  afternoon "on our own". We wandered around Fira a bit and then stopped 
	  at a wonderful restaurant with Fred and Robin. I had lamb kleftes and a beer. 
	  Yum. I think Marj had yoghurt and honey.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_53.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      After lunch we wandered some more and then decided to head back 
	  down to the ship. Fred and Robin were going to do the gondola, but Marj and
	   I decided to walk down the donkey path (as we had done on our previous
	   trip).	  The top part of the path was a little slow as we had to navigate through a herd 
	  of waiting donkeys. There must have been 20 of them. It was very hot in the late 
	  afternoon sun, so we took our time walking down. The view was fabulous as we 
	  walked down, with the blue sky and sunshine on the buildings. After about 20 
	  minutes or so we reached the port (Skala Firon) below. I just had to have a gelato,
	  so we checked out the restaurants along the waterfront and found one that
	  served gelato. We boarded the ship about 5:00. Dinner was to be at 8:00,
	  so we had a nice read on the upper deck.</p>
	  <p>Dinner was about 8:00. Another great meal. We had another reading from
       the Odyssey at 9:00. I was getting to really like the readings. Then it was time for bed.
