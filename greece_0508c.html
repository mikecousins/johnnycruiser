        <h3>Day 13, 14 (June 2, 3) - Sailing to Ios (Pop. 1,654)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_54.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  It was another early start today as the ship left for Ios at 5:30 AM. The engines
	  lulled me back to sleep and I didn't wake up until; 7:45!  I had a chance to sit 
	  on the upper deck for a short time as breakfast was called at 8:30. At  9:30,
	  we all met on the upper deck and John gave us a lecture on marriage in early 
	  Greek (Roman) society. Apparently not much written description of early Greek 
	  society exists, so we rely on records of later Roman society to approximate 
	  the earlier Greek society.</p>
	  <p>Shortly after, about 10:00 we arrived at a small bay (Manganari) for a swim 
	  stop. As we arrived, a shepherd brought about 30 or 40 goats down to the water. 
	  Each goat must have had a bell, because there was a cacophony of bells clanging.
	  We were anchored quite a way out in the bay and it looked like a nice 
	  swimming beach. So, the captain broke out the Zodiac and ferried the swimmers 
	  to the shore. After ferrying those who wished to swim, I asked the captain if I could 
	  go for a ride with him. He said "Sure", and we went for a ride. We ended up at a small
	  fishing boat anchored nearby in the bay. After some discussion, one of the fishermen 
	  retrieved 3 large lobster and a crab from the hold. That was to become our lunch later.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_55.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  We left Manganari about noon and reached Gialos about 1:00. We had lunch
	  on the ship (lobster) and then were given the rest of the day "on our own". 
	  We headed off walking through the town. At the ferry terminal (or at least the
	  building where you buy the tickets), there was an internet cafe, so we
	  sent a quick email home. We walked back along the waterfront and then hiked a short 
	  trail to a beautiful white church - the Agia Eirini. It was on a point of land and must have
	  been subjected to almost constant winds, because the nearby trees were all sloping 
	  in one direction.</p>
	  <p>We were back on the ship at 6:00 for another reading of the
	  Odyssey. Oh, I should mention that Ios is the island where Homer is
	  purportedly buried. We saw a statue of him earlier in the town. I think that it
	  was after the reading that Laura announced the fact that there would be high winds
	  and rough seas tomorrow, so we would not chance another seasick day but
	  instead spend a whole extra day on Ios. After the reading Marj and I headed up 
	  through the town intending to visit the Chora above. However, we inadvertently
	  took the long route, and it was starting to get dark before we reached "the
	  Village". So we returned to the ship, leaving our Chora visit for tomorrow.
	  Dinner was on our own, so we popped into the local grocery store
	  and bought some youghurt and chocolate milk. We joined Fred and Robin
	  on the upper deck for dinner - we with our yoghurt and they with their taramosalada .
	  And, of course, beer! Then to bed.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_56.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	 The next day was exactly as advertised. It was windy and the sea was very
	 choppy. It was an excellent decision to take a down day in Ios. Nothing like
	 being stranded in Paradise. I was up early to start the day on the upper deck.
	 Breakfast call came at 8:00. Following breakfast, at 9:00, John did a lecture
	 on prices and wages. Once again due to the dirth of information available
	 from Greek records, we learned mostly from the Roman era. I wonder
	 what a computer programmer would have made in ancient Rome?</p>
	 <p>Marj and I headed out for another walk around the town. This time we
	 decided to take the city bus up to "the Village", so we would be sure to
	 get to the right place. The bus came every half hour, so we didn't have to
	 wait long. It went up far past where we had walked to the previous evening.
	 After about 10 minutes we arrived at the Chora and got off the bus.
	 Across the street was a beautiful whitewashed cathedral (Agia Aekaterini - 
	 St. Catherine). We walked over to the church, took some pictures, and then
	 headed up village on the hillside behind the church. The narrow streets were
	 twisty, with occasional views of the ocean. There were loads of shops,
	 restaurants, bars and hotels. A strange thing was that there were several
	 Irish bars and restaurants - in Greece? What a beautiful town!
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_57.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
     At noon, we encountered a restaurant called "Seven Eleven" and decided to give it 
	 a try. It had Greek and foreign food on the menu. Marjorie had mousakka, and 
	 I had a snitzel. It was very good. The young waitress didn't sound Greek, so I 
	 asked her where she was from.  Halifax! What a small world. The permanent
	 population of the island is about 1,600 people, but in the summer it swells
	 to 20,000! We were there just prior to tourist season, so it seemed quite
	 deserted. Actually we noticed this on most of the islands.  Most of the
	 restaurants we graced were almost empty.</p>
	 <p>It was a beautiful day, so we walked back to the ship. There was a special footpath
	 that shortcutted the switchback road and it didn't take us all that
	 long. There was a small grocery store across from the ship so we decided to
	 supplement our usual breakfast fare with yoghurt and chocolate milk. Monica
	 allowed us to store the food in her fridge. It worked out well and relieved the
	 monotony of the same old breakfast every day.
	 We spent the remainder of the afternoon reading on the rear deck.
	 At 7:00 John did another reading from the Odyssey. Dinner was at
	 8:00 . The entree was mousakka. Marj didn't mind at all having it twice in
	 one day, and claimed it was even better on the ship. After dinner we did another walk 
	 along the marina checking out the beautiful yachts and a large
	 pirate ship. Then to bed.

        <h3>Day 15 (June 4) - Sailing to Naxos (Pop. 20,000)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_58.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	 Another early morning up on the upper deck. The wind had abated and it looked 
	 good for sailing today. Breakfast call was early today - 7:00. An hour later we
	 sailed away from Ios, heading to the island of Naxos. It was relatively calm
	 in the open water between the islands. Smooth sailing!</p>
	 <p>At about 11:00 we reached Naxos and pulled into a small bay (Kastraki)
	 for a swim stop. We stayed in the bay for about an hour, then pulled up anchor
	 and headed to the main town - Naxos Town. It was about a two hour sail, so
	 we had lunch onboard during the transit (1:00). We finally arrived in Naxos Town
	 about 2:00. It was one of the largest towns we had visited on the islands,
	 with a population of around 15,000 people. The town was mostly along the waterfront, 
	 with no Chora on the hillside above. In the middle of the town was a large
	 Venetian fortress, part of the Kastro built in 1207. However, we didn't have
	 time to explore the town at this point, as the bus was there for our trip around
	 the island.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_59.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  Naxos is a huge island. Once we got away from the ocean, it seemed that we 
	  were back on the mainland. The lanscape was parched, with low shrubs and 
	  scraggly trees. It is very mountainous, so the road was quite twisty. We passed 
	  through the village of Ano Sagri, with the beautiful little chapple of Agios Ioannis
	  Gyroulas, and then finally reached the town of Chalki
	  (or Halki) in the Tragaia Valley about 3:30. </p>
	  <p>Chalki was an interesting town - a mix of newer homes and buildings and 
	  some ancient decrepit buildings. At one time it was the capital of Naxos.
	  We walked to the old Byzantine Fragopoulis
	  tower, which is now a hotel or hostel. Then we walked along a path through an 
	  olive orchard to a very old church. I think it's called Panagia Protothroni.
	  Unfortunately it wasn't open. Then we retraced our steps into the town and 
	  headed to the Kitron "Vallindras", a local distillery. Kitron is a kind of lemon
	  liquor, except the fruit is much larger, like an orange, and it is made from the leaves,
	  keeping much more flavour than the fruit. The distillery was opened in 1896.
	  We sampled a number of different kitron drinks. Too strong for me!
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_60.jpg" align="left" border="0"> After 
        tweaking our thirst at the distillery, we wandered to an outdoor restaurant 
        and had something more thirst quenching. I had an Alpha beer. Then we 
        wandered back to the bus to continue our sightseeing trip. We passed through 
        the village of Moni, clinging to the hillside. Finally we came to the 
        Melanes Valley, home of some huge marble quarries and the famous abandoned 
        <i>Kouroi</i>, huge marble statues. We parked just off the road and headed down an
		Oleander lined pathway. The trail wound through a private garden and suddenly there
		was a kouros lying in front of us. It was very weathered and broken in places, but was
		quite impressive. We continued on the path and came to an open area where we had 
		to climb up the hillside. Part way up was a second kouros, lying on its back. 
		Nearby was a pedestal with feet broken off above the ankle. I presume these
		used to be attached to the fallen kouros. We were running out of our alloted time,
		so had to hurry back to the bus. About 30 minutes later we were back at the ship in 
		Naxos Town. It was 6:00.
		<br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_61.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  Dinner and the evening were "on our own". We found a nice restaurant (not 
	  hard in Greece!) and had a small meal. I had a Greek salad and Marj had
	  yoghurt. I must say that the Greek salads have been excellent, although each
	  restaurant makes them differently. There is a large variation in the cheese too,
	  from very creamy to dry and crumbly. But it's all good!</p>
	  <p>There was still some evening daylight so we walked along the dock, over a
	  causeway and onto the little islet of Palatia. On top of a small hill is the Portara
	  gateway to the unfinished Temple of Apollo. A pathway encircles the site, so 
	  you can view it from all sides. It was a great overlook of the ocean and a Blue 
	  Star ferry was just coming into the dock. Walking back to the ship we stopped 
	  at a statue (an obelisk, actually) commemorating Athina. 
	  Back on board we taught Fred and Robin the dice game and played a few
	  rounds. I think they enjoyed it. It was a great day. Time for bed.

        <h3>Day 16 (June 5) - Sailing to Paros (Pop. 10,300)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_62.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Up early as usual for some tiume on the upper deck. Today was to be spent
	  on Paros, an island that we would see in the distance. Breakfast call was
	  at 8:00. At 9:00 we set sail for Paros. By 10:30 we had reached the island and 
	  stopped into a small bay (Amoelas) for a swim. The bay was fairly deserted
	  other than a few people on the beach. Some of the group swam off the ship, 
	  while others were zodiaced ashore for a beach swim. After about an hour we 
	  raised anchor and sailed to the port of Naousa, where we would anchor for 
	  the night. It was about 12:30 and we were given time for lunch "on our own". It
	  wasn't much time, as a tour bus would be picking us up at  2:00. </p>
	  <p>We quickly picked out a nearby restaurant and Marj, Paul and I ordered
	  a couple of pizzas (and beer).  Greek restaurants are annoyingly slow, but we
	  managed to finish the pizza and pay our bill in time to catch the bus.
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_63.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      We left Naousa on schedule and headed over the hills towards the town of 
	  Paroikia. The landscape was once again arid, although there were some
	  olive and citrous orchards which were obviously irrigated. As we drove through
	  the hills, we passed by the remains of three 17th century churches, Tris Ekklisies. 
	  Shortly we reached Paroikia, the main city on the island. The bus stopped on the
	  harbour front, very near to the famous windmill.</p>
	  <p>We walked as a group to visit the Ekatontapyliani (Church of 100 Doors).
	  We were the only people there so it was peaceful to walk through the church.
	  The church is the oldest church in Greece in continuous use and is a major
	  Byzantine monument. Its official name is the Dormition of the Virgin. It consists of
	  3 interlocking builds and is purported to have 99 windows and doors. According
	  to legend, when the 100th door is found, Constantinople will return to the Greeks.
	  The inside of the church was beautiful with many chandeliers, carvings and 
	  paintings. I really enjoyed visiting this church.

      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_64.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      After visiting the church, we were given about an hour of our own. We wandered
	  through the narrow streets and alleyways stopping at boutiques and handicraft
	  shops.  At every turn was an outdoor restaurant or bar. I just love walking 
	  through these little towns.</p>
	  <p>We returned to the bus a bit early, so watched the high speed ferry
	  dock and unload its passengers. Finally we were all back on the bus and off 
	  through the mountains into the heart of the island. We passed by several 
	  small villages perched on the mountain side.  Eventually we came to the village
	  of Lefkes. The bus stopped here and let us out to explore the village.
	  It was an exquisite little village. The streets were narrow and twisty opening
	  up onto small gardens or plazas. One could quite easily get lost here! We
	  wandered around for a while and then ended up at an outdoor
	  restaurant / bar where a lot of the group had gathered. Most were having
	  drinks, but we decided to wait until we got back to the ship. Then we returned to
	  where we had been dropped us off to reboard the bus.

      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_65.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  It was a fair drive back to the ship. We passed mountains and valleys and 
	  could finally see the ocean. We were dropped off at the ship in Naousa 
	  about 5:00. It had been a great sightseeing trip. We had a couple of hours 
	  to wander around the town of Naousa. The harbourfront was amazing, with 
	  all the yachts and fishing boats and the sidewalk cafes along the docks.
	  The streets in behind the main street were narrow and twisty, and either
	  motorbikes or pedestrian only.
	  Everything was whitewashed with blue trim.</p>
	  <p>We reboarded the ship at 7:00 for another reading from the Odyssey.
	  I think that Odysseus had returned home at this point and was hiding out 
	  with his shepherd. Dinner was on the ship at 8:00. After dinner we
	  did another walk along the marina. It was a beautiful evening. Then
	  it was back on board and to bed.

        <h3>Day 17 (June 6) - Sailing to Delos, Mykonos (Pop. 4,500)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_66.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Today was to be the second repeat visit of the trip - we had been to Delos and
	  Mykonos before. However, our previous trip had been only for an afternoon,
	  and that was spent on Delos. Hence, we really hadn't seen any of Mykonos.
	  Also I was hoping that this time it would be sunny (for photos) as last time
	  it had been overcast all day.  It was an early start  from Paros, with the engines
	  starting up at 6:30. Up on deck it was cold and overcast.
	  The call for breakfast came at 7:30 when we were well
	  underway. As we sailed towards Delos, we were joined by three dolphins (or
	  perhaps more). They were at the front of the ship and seemed to swim right 
	  underneath. Soon they disappeared and we sailed on unaccompanied.</p>
	  <p>We arrived at Delos about 9:30. It was still quite cool and cloudy. We anchored
	  in the bay and needed the zodiac to reach the dock. I went with the first 
	  group of 4 or 5 passengers. This was a mistake. The bottom of the zodiac
	  was ankle deep with water, so our group had the honour of soaking it up
	  with our socks and runners. Subsequent groups had no water problem thanks to us.
	  Then the captain missed the first (easily accessible) set of steps on the
	  dock and instead took us to another area behind a docked yacht where we had
	  to duck under ropes or risk decapitation. 
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_67.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      The zodiac continued shuttling passengers and soon we were all gathered on
	  the shore at the gates to the archaeological site. We had a further wait as
	  the guide hadn't arrived yet. He finally arrived and we headed off through the ruins.
	  It was still quite cold and started to rain. Oh no, I wanted sunshine! Then, like magic,
	  part way through our tour, the sun broke through and it became a beautiful day.
	  We did the same tour as on our previous tour, but then did some extra (which was nice).
	  Our guide parted ways with us at the entrance to the museum.
	  We entered the museum which had many statues, sculptures, etc from the site.
	  Then we hiked up to the highest part of the ancient city to see the floor mosaics
	  of the House of Dolphins and the House of Masks. </p>
	  <p>We hiked back to the dock and waited for the zodiac to shuttle us back to the ship.
	  It was quite warm by now. We were all back on the ship by 1:00. It was time to 
	  sail to Mykonos. Along the way we stopped at a small bay (Agios Ioannis) for a swim.
	  At 2:00 lunch was served as we floated in the bay. After lunch we set sail for
	  Mykonos Town.
       <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_68.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	 We were in for a surprise as we entered the Mykonos Town harbour. Because
	 our itinerary was not hard and fast, the captain was requesting docking space
	 as we arrived at each island. Today we were out of luck, the harbour was
	 full. Instead we had to sail about 2 or 3 miles north of the town to the new 
	 cruise ship terminal (under construction). The dock was OK, but we were a 
	 long way from town. However, a decision was quickly reached and the
	 captain headed off to rent a car. Of course, being a typical European country,
	 the biggest car available was what we would call a "compact" car. Marj and
	 I went in the first shuttle run. There were five of us (and the captain). Three of
	 us squished into the back seat, while Dave and Jan layered into the front
	 passenger seat. It was crowded! Subsequent runs only took 4 passengers
	 each time. Much better idea! It was about 4:00 and we had dinner and the rest of 
	 the evening "on our own".</p>
	 <p>Paul was in our first shuttle group, so he, Marj and I wandered together 
	 through the town. We headed into the narrow streets dodging the motorcycles.
	 This was certainly the busiest island town  that we visited so far. Lot's of
	 people everywhere. It was very hot and we came upon a store advertising 
	 smoothies. We each ordered one (mine was strawberry and banana), but were
	 disappointed. The ingredients were not very cold, and a couple of ice cubes 
	 had been tossed in later, rather than being blended with the drink. So far,
	 Aigina was winning the smoothie contest by a mile.
	 We took one little alley that led to an ocean view. When we 
	 got to the end of the alley, the we had a wonderful view of the Kato Myloi
	 area with the 5 windmills. On the rocks, just in from of us, 3 large white
	 pelicans were lying in the sun. This was the area called "Little Venice". The 
	 buildings were flush with the ocean. 
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_69.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      We found an oceanside bar and decided to stop in for a drink. Our seats
	  were on a porch overhanging the ocean. What a view! Paul and I
	  both ordered a Mythos beer. (Marj just had water). The first surprise was that 
	  we were served 12 oz bottles - everywhere else in Greece they served 500 ml 
	  bottles. Then came the second surprise. We normally paid E2.50 to E3.00 
	  at restaurants for the half litre bottle. Our bill was E14.00 for the two small beer!
	  Mykonos was expensive! We headed back into the interior of the town.
	 Nearby we heard a brass band that sounded like each musician was playing a 
	 different song. Peeking in a large white building, there was a young kids' band 
	 practicing. Further on we encountered a group of kids doing Greek dancing 
	 at a replica stone theatre. An interesting town.</p>
	 <p>We eventually came upon a large plaka with a number of restaurants. We
	 picked one and had dinner there. As we were eating, a huge pelican came 
	 walking through the restaurant. One of the waiters retreived a large fish from 
	 the kitchen and tossed it down the grateful beak. Young children were running
	 around the pelican having a great time. Then suddenly there were two
	 pelicans. I guess the free handouts atrracted them. After eating we slowly wandered
	 back along the docks to the place where our captain had agreed to pick us up.
	 The captain had planned on doing hourly pickups, but, of course, everyone decided to
	 come back at about the same time. Anyway, we got in on the 9:30 pickup
	 and were back on the ship by 10:00. It was a great day. time for bed.

        <h3>Day 18 (June 7) - Sailing to Tinos (Pop. 9,000), Syros (Pop. 23,000)</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_70.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  Another new day. Up at 6:30. I decided to go for a walk on the new dock to see 
	  what was happening. There were palettes of slate tiles, presumeably to be
	  used as a surface on the dock. Two workmen were splitting stone and 
	  building a decorative wall along the center of the dock. At 8:00 the call
	  came for breakfast so I reboarded the ship. At 9:00 the engines fired up and 
	  we were off to the island of Tinos. It was a fairly short distance and we arrived 
	  at Tinos about 10:30. We were given until 1:00 for lunch "on our own".</p>
	  <p>We headed off onto the island. Tinos town was a typical island village.
	  The main street followed the coast line with docks and yachts on one side and
	  commercial buildings on the other side. A number of restaurants had tables 
	  outdoors along the sidewalk. From there, the town was built up the hill. Going
	  deeper into the town (ie. up), the streets became narrower, eventually pedestrian 
	  only. Everywhere were restaurants, bars and souvenir shops. 
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_71.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  What was unusual about this town was it had a second "main" street running 
	  right up the hill from the waterfront. This street, called Megalochari, runs for
	  several blocks and terminates in a large plaka in front of an immense
	  church (Panagia Evangelistria). Running parallel to this street is a narrow
	  pedestrian alley lined with shops selling huge candles and religious paraphenalia.
	  People buy these items and carry them up to the church in order to pray
	  for health or other reasons. It is also common for pilgrims to crawl all
	  the way up the road and into the church in order to receive special
	  blessings. </p>
	  <p>We followed a small crowd walking up the street and even passed 
	  several pilgrims crawling along. The candles the people were carrying were
	  huge - about 5 to 6 feet long. At the top of the hill was a larger than life size statue 
	  of  a crawling woman. The religious shops were packed with pictures, carvings, 
	  etc. as well as embossed metal tags featuring body parts such as arms and legs.
	  I think these were to specify which parts of the body needed healing.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_72.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  The church complex was huge. It was three stories from the front. The bottom 
	  floor (grade level) contained "chambers featuring religious artifacts and small 
	  chapels. In one of the chapels a child was being baptized. We went up the
	  outside stairs to the main floor where the church itself was. We were wearing 
	  t-shirts and shorts so I decided not to enter the church. However, Marj and 
	  some others lined up and went in anyway. At least they weren't thrown in jail!
	  The church was quite dark inside, but i managed to stick my camera through a 
	  window and get a photo. Marj (and others) said that the religious fervor was 
	  quite high inside. I guess those who crawled all that way wanted to get their
	  money's worth.</p>
	  <p>I walked around the outside cloisters exploring the immense church. 
	  There were outbuildings all around. Finally Marj exited from the church and 
	  we headed back down  to the lower town, taking a narrow alleyway lined with 
	  religious shops. I noticed that these shops, especially those further from the 
	  church, were hedging their bets and selling regular Greek Isles souvenirs to
	  those not interested in regilious stuff.
     <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_73.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	   We still had some time so we sought out a good dockside restaurant. I had
	   my usual Greek salad and beer, while Marj had some yoghurt and honey.
	   Then it was time to get on the ship again and set sail. It was about 1:15
	   when we left the port and headed across the water to Syros.</p>
	   <p>We anchored at the north end of Syros for a swim stop at a small bay
	   (called Sykamia?). After the swim we continued on to Ermoupoli, the main
	   city on the island. We arrived about  3:00. Ermoupoli was unlike any
	   of the other towns we had been to. Syros is the administrative center
	   of the Cycladic Islands (sort of like a provincial capital) and is the most
	   populous island of the group. The town featured many 3 or 4 story buildings, 
	   unusual for island architecture. There were few souvenir shops and most
	   buildings were commercial, administrative or hotels, sort of like a large 
	   city's downtown area. Most of the streets were autombile size with some 
	   sporadic traffic. We headed into the town and came upon a huge public 
	   square in front the the town hall. Continuing up the hillside, we came to a 
	   huge church. Past the church was a lookout over a bay and a public beach.
	   Even this far into the town, we didn't see anything resembling the narrow
	   alleys and small shops of the other islands.
	  <br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_74.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  We really enjoyed our walk around the town. It was a saturday and most of 
	  the shops were closed. The local business hours throughout Greece were 
	  quite unusual. Stores would be open in the morning and then close about 
	  2:00 PM. On weekdays they would reopen about 5:00. However, on Saturdays 
	  they would remain closed in the afternoon and evening. Of course the
	  souvenir shops and restaurants that catered to tourists would be open
	  at all hours (or so it seemed). We were also warned that restaurants often 
	  didn't serve dinner until 8:00 PM or later. That might suit the locals, but
	  tourist pressure has made then accessible throughout the day. We never
	  had any problem finding an open restaurant at any time for lunch or dinner.</p>
	  <p>I returned to the ship earlier than Marj, as I had to use the bathroom and 
	  couldn't find any public toilets on our walk. I couldn't find Marj after that so we
	  spent the rest of our free time each taking pictures in different parts of the
	  town. We met back at the ship just before 6:00. Marj had done her usual
	  grocery store visit to pick up some milk and yoghurt. It was fun shopping
	  in the Greek stores as all the labels were in Greek. You weren't sure if
	  you were buying yoghurt, cottage cheese or margerine! And flavourings
	  were fun to guess too.
     <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_75.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	   At 6:00 we all gathered on the upper deck for the present exchange. This
	   was the popular format where people drew numbers and then in order chose a
	   present from the pile or stole from someone who had already opened a
	   present. You know the drill! There were 21 of us, so it took quite a while. All
	   in all, people's choices of gifts were excellent, so there was lots of stealing and
	   intrigue. The gifts that we bought were each stolen a couple of times, so we 
	   were pleased about that. Marjorie ended up with a small pottery bowl with
	   a lid, and I chose a deck of cards with mythological beings on them. We
	   were quite pleased with our choices. The whole process took about 1.5 hours.</p>
	   <p>Dinner call came at 8:00. We had our present exchange and "farewell
	   dinner" tonight, because tomorrow night we would be packing and getting 
	   ready for our 3:00 AM departure to the airport. After dinner we jumped ship 
	   again and wandered along the docks. There's nothing nicer than walking 
	   by rows of yachts and fishing boats on a warm evening. It's heaven! Then
	   to bed.

        <h3>Day 19 (June 8) - Sailing to Kea (Pop. 1,600), Lavrio</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_76.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  Sadly it was our last full day in the islands. It was a long sail to our next 
	  destination, Kea, so we left early from Syros at 6:00 AM. About 8:00 we 
	  passed a small deserted island called Giaros and I think the plan was
	  to stop there for breakfast and a swim break. However, for whatever reason,
	  we bypassed the island. Breakfast was served just after 8:00 as we motored along.
	  About 10:00, we arrived Kea and stopped at a small bay (Otzias) 
	  for a swim break. The captain donned his mask and snorkel and joined the 
	  swimmers caying a plastic bag. It turned out that he was harvesting black 
	  sea urchins. When he came back on board he broke them open and scooped
	  out the orange roe. He let everyone have a taste on a cracker. It reminded
	  me of caviar - salty fish oil! </p>
	  <p>After the swimmers had returned, we continued our sail to the port
	  of  Korissia. Korissia is a very small village of a few hundred people. The 
	  port was very quiet with not too many ships at  the dock. It was about noon.
     <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_77.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  After we docked, we were given about 2.5 hours for lunch on our own. The town wasn't
	  much more than the main street. All the restaurants were along this street. We
	  wandered the length of the waterfront to check things out. At the north end
	  of the harbour, we looked for a cafe recommended by the captain. It turned out to
	  be a bakery with not much in the way of lunch. A few doors down was a burger place
	  that had good Gyros. There we left Paul, Lee and Lynn. I really just wanted
	  a Greek salad, so we continued down the street. We finally met Jim and Josie in
	  a nice little sidewalk cafe. We joined them and I had my Greek salad and beer. 
	  Marj had a deep fried spinach appetizer. The service was very slow at this 
	  restaurant	 but that's normal in Greece, right? We waited a long time for the
	  bill, and Marj took off down the road to do some shopping at the "Shop & Go"
	  grocery store. I think Josie headed off somewhere as well.
	  I finally caught the waiter's attention and asked for the bill. That 
	  caused him to disappear for another 15 minutes or so. Glad we had 2 hours!</p>
	  <p>Marj returned from the grocery store and found Jim and I still sitting waiting 
	  for the bill. Fortunately the waiter showed up soon after and we paid the bill.
	  We all met back at the ship at 2:30 and marched to the south end of the 
	  harbour to board our bus. We were going to the village of Ioulis, high in
	  the hills. It is the capital of Kea.
	<br clear=right>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_78.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  It was a narrow, twisty drive up into the hills, but soon we were at the town of Ioulis.
	  The road went around the edge of the town, once you entered the town it was 
	  pedestrian only. The first thing we did was locate a gelato shop. It was very hot 
	  out and the gelato was so good! Then Paul, Marj and I  headed into the interior 
	  of the town (ie. up the hill). it was a beautiful little town. The hillside was quite
	  steep, so some of the "streets" were more like steps.  Like other towns we had visited,
	  it was difficult to know where you were going as the high walls on either side
	  made it difficult to see. Only up and down were clear. Every so often you
	  would get a view down the valley, then you could tell where you were (sort of).</p>
	  <p>As we walked up one street, we encountered a man on a donkey. The donkey's
	  body was straddling the path and its head was inside a tavern. The man on the 
	  donkey was very talkative and asked if we were English (meaning, I think, if we
	  spoke English). Apparently some of our group had passed by earlier and he
	  had invited them in for a drink. We just said "Hi" and passed by. There were several
	  small churches along the way. All of the towns seemed to have many small
	  churches - about one church for every 10 or so houses. I assume that they
	  are mostly Greek Orthodox churches, so they must have many small, local
	  congregations. Can't complain that it's too far to go to church! At
	  4:00 we all met back at the entrance to the town to get back on the bus.
	  It was a very warm day, so the sir conditioned ride back to the ship was a
	  nice change.
     <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_79.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  Back at the ship we had a few minutes for a final walk along the harbourfront
	  of Korissia. It was sad knowing that this was to be our last walk on a Greek island.
	  Each and every island we had visited was beautiful and I just loved walking
	  both the harbourfronts and the hillside villages. I could easily waste away
	  my life here! But reality strikes and we boarded the ship for our last port - 
	  Lavrio, on the mainland. We were heading to Lavrio because it was only a 
	  short distance away, and it is closer to the Athens airport than Piraeus is.
	  At 4:30, we sailed away from Kea, passing the island of Makronissos, and
	  on up the coast of the mainland. We passed Cape Sounion and could see the 
	  Temple of Poseidon. It seemed like months ago that we were hiking
	  around the temple.</p>
	  <p>About 6:00 we finally docked at a container dock in Lavrio. What a change
	  from all the little marinas we had been in for 2 weeks. We were welcomed by 
	  a pack of "homeless" dogs. Dinner was at 7:00, a bit earlier than normal. This 
	  was because our bus was going to be picking us up at 3:30 AM in order for
	  us to make our 6:00 AM flight. After dinner we all packed our bags and carried 
	  them up from the bowels of the ship (ie. our cabins) and dumped them in the 
	  lounge / dining area. We went out for a final walk on the dock and watched a
	  huge crane moving containers around. Then it was time for bed and a couple 
	  of hours sleep.

        <h3>Day 20 (June 9) - Return to Calgary</h3>
      </center>
      <p><img src="images/diary_greece_0508/photo_greece_0508_80.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  We slept until 2:30 AM when a few people started moving around. (We had
	  planned on sleeping until 3:00). We went up to the 
	  dining area and raided the fridge for the goodies that Marj had bought
	  yesterday at Korissia. We dined on Yoghurt and chocolate milk. Monica 
	  bellowed the 3:00 AM wakeup call and soon the ship was filled with people 
	  and their backpacks. Then it was time to say goodbye to the crew and board
	  the bus. The crew would soon be sailing back to Piraeus to get ready for their 
	  next set of passengers. The bus ride was about 30 minutes to the airport.</p>
	  <p>Our flights were on time and relatively smooth. Our first leg as about
	  2.5 hours to Frankfurt. At the Frankfurt airport we picked up an English
	  newspaper and read about a 6.3 earthquake the previous day near
	  Epidaurus. We were on Kea when it happened and didn't feel a thing. It
	  was strong enough that a couple of people were killed. Then we boarded
	  the long 9 hour flight back to Calgary.We had a couple of meals, played 
	  some cards and watched some TV. 
      <br clear=left>
      <p><img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_85.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  The flight landed on time (about noon, local time) and we did the baggage 
	  and customs thing. Chrissy came from across the way (she was working
	  at the airport location) and drove us home. It was nice to be home again
	  to see our kitties, and to spend some time in a real bed and a real 
	  bathroom ...</p>
	  <p>Overall the trip was a fabulous success. We loved Athens and all 
	  of the islands, and it was so nice to travel with such a great bunch of
	  people. We loved being up on deck as we plowed through the blue
	  waters (except for one memorable day).
	  And, of course, we really appreciated the efforts of John and Laura
	  in making it such a wonderful trip. The only negative (and it's fast fading 
	  from my mind) were the sleeping conditions on the boat which certainly 
	  weren't the greatest. Oh yes, another negative was that the trip
	  ended far too early! I was ready for a few more islands.
