	  <p>Retracing our steps from 22 years ago, we had only the Island of Kaua'i left to revisit. We had always visited Hawai'i
	  in April, May or June before, but this time decided to try September. (3 - 11).  We wanted to visit the entire island and 
	  knew how heavy the traffic could be through the Kapa'a / Lihue area, so booked 2 nights in Princeville and 5 nights in 
	  Po'ipu Beach.</p>
	  <p>We arrived in Lihue and headded out to our hotel in Princeville. The traffic through Lihue and Kapa'a was 
	  horrendous. We finally made it to our condo at Hanalei Bay Resort - almost looking over Hanalei Bay. We checked in,
	  did a walk around the hotel grounds and then called it a day.</p>
	  <p>The next morning we headed down to Ke'e Beach for a snorkel. It was great. We stopped along the way to overlook the
	  large fields of taro. That afternoon we drove westward to vist the guava plantation. Very interesting. We had dinner that night
	  in the village of Hanalei.</p>

      <br clear=right>
	  <p>The following day we headed to Ha'ena Beach Park for a morning snorkel. It is a beautiful beach. After lunch we
	  drove to the Kilauea lighthouse and bird sanctuary. The small peninsula was very windy. There were lots of sea birds
	  on a small island and on the banks of the "mainland".</p>
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_06.jpg" align="left" border="0">

      <br clear=left>
	  <p>We had booked two nights  at Princeville and now it was time to relocate to our condo in Po'ipu. After checking in, we 
	  headed to our favorite spot at Po'ipu Beach. The sandbar peninsula was now an island. The water was quite shallow,
	  but the snorkeling was good. We went for dinner at the Green Garden Restaurant in Hanapepe, but it just wasn't the 
	  same as it was 22 years ago. Po'ipu had changed dramatically since we were last here in 1982. Koloa was much bigger and
	  very busy, there were many more hotels in the Po'ipu area, and there was much more traffic.</p>
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_10.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_11.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      <br clear=right>
	  <p>Thenext day we headed up to Wailua to snorkel at Lidgate Park in Kapa'a. On the way we stopped at the new SPCA 
	  facility, just south of Lihue. It was a beautiful, large new building on a huge acreage of trees and flowers. What a paradise for
	  the animals! Then it was on to the park. We hadn't been there before. The 
	  enclosed area was great for swimming, but there weren't a lot of fish there. </p>

	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_13.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      <br clear=right>
	  <p>Finally we came to the highlight of our trip. Today we had booked a helicopter flight up the Napili Coast. I had
	  booked with the only company that flew with the doors off! It was a 2 hour flight that included a lunch stop at a remote
	  falls and pool. The flight left from Port Allen, not too far from Po'ipu Beach.
	  Marjorie and I had the two rear seats and the view without the doors was fabulous. The Napili coast
	  was very rugged - no wonder the highway couldn't pass through this terrain! The lunch stop was great, with two 
	  helicopters arriving. Some of the passengers swam in the pool. It was a clear, warm day and the view from the
	  helicopter was fabulous. What a great day!.</p>
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_14.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_15.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      <br clear=right>
	  <p>The next day we drove down through Ele'ele and Hanapepe to Kekaha and headed up the Waimea Canyon. It
	  was a bit cloudy, so the view wasn't as spectacular. Still, it is a very interesting drive and the canyon is huge.
	  On the way back we stopped  at Jo Jo's in Hanapepe for a shaved ice. It was great! We also wandered down the street
	  and found an outlet for Aunty Lilikoi Passion Fruit Products. We bought some syrups and jams to take back as
	  souvenirs and gifts. After we returned to our condo, we went for an afternoon snorkel at Po'ipu Beach.
	  </p>

	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_17.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      <br clear=right>
 	  <p>The next day we drove a short distance west of Po'ipu Beach to try snorkeling at  Koloa Landing. The snorkeling
	  was pretty good, with a fair number of fish. Then we headed further along the road (the road to the blow hole) and
	  stopped at the small beach at Ho'ai Bay. Marj didn't come in with me as she was afraid of a possible current. So, I 
	  headed out on my own. A ways out from the shore I came to a spot where many turtles were resting on the bottom.
	  I've never seen so many at once. At any time there were two or three of them surfacing for a breath of air.
	  It was awesome! We headed further down to the blow hole and did the souvenir booths. Then we headed back
	  to veg out at the condo. Each evening we headed to the beach for sunset pictures. There wasn't a spectacular
	  sunset this trip.</p>
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_18.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_19.jpg" align="right" border="0">

	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_20.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_21.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      <br clear=right>
 	  <p>On our final day, our flight wasn't until the afternoon. We did a last walk down to Po'ipu Beach and were
	  rewarded with two Monk Seals - a mother and her pup. They were frolicking in the surf and rocks just off of the beach.
	  The parks people were there so we could not get too close. The Monk Seals are an endangered species, so
	  it was great to see them. Afterwards we were wandering through a nearby hotel garden and came upon a juvenile
	  Black-capped Night Heron fishing in a small lily pond.</p>
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_22.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_23.jpg" align="right" border="0">

 	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_24.jpg" align="left" border="0">
	  <img src="images/photo_hawaii_0904_25.jpg" align="right" border="0">
      <br clear=right>
	  <p>Then it was time to head to our inter-island flight  to Honolulu, and then back to Calgary. It had been a wonderful vacation.
	  I'd love to come back to Kaua'i again.</p>
