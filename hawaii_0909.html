      <p>Once again it was time to head for Hawai'i. As usual, Marjorie had no holidays
	  so this was to be another trip with the kids. Mike and Stacy could get 2 weeks off, while
	  Matt and Chrissy could only get one week. We voted on time and place, picking the
	  end of Sept and early Oct to visit Kona and Hilo on the Big Island. I set about booking
	  accomodations and car rental. Although tourism was way down because of the economy,
	  for some reason one of the weeks was heavily booked (and very expensive).
	  Unbeknownst to
	  me was that fact that we would be overlapping with the week of Ironman! Due to the kids 
	  schedules (and an upcoming cruise for Marj and I), we were unable to reschedule away 
	  from Ironman week. Oh well, it was only money!</p>
	  <p>I really lucked out on accomodations. I was able to get a 3br/3ba condo unit in Kona
	  and a 3br/3ba house in Pahoa (near Hilo). The Kona condo was especially nice because
	  it had air conditioning in each room, and 2 nice swimming pools in the complex. The
	  Hilo house was right  across the road from the "tidepools" snorkelling site. The house
	  rental agency also had special deals on car rentals, so I was able to book through
	  them for much less than I could get on the Web.

	  <p>For the first week it would be Mike, Stacy and me. We had an early flight out of
	  Calgary, so Mike and Stacy overnighted at our place. Marj dropped us off at the airport.
	  Our flight took us through Seattle and then to Kona. We arrived in Kona about noon.
	  Our rental car was ready - a mid-size car (can't remember what it was).
	  The north end of Kailua had been recently developed with new shopping malls. 
	  We stopped at a strip mall and grabbed some lunch from Subway and Taco
	  del Mar. We picked up the keys for the condo from the Sunquest building. 
	  We drove to our gated condo complex at the south end
	  of Ali'i Drive, and found our unit. After we moved
	  our stuff in and picked our bedrooms, I tried to get the air conditioning working. No
	  luck. So, I phoned the rental people and reported the problem. The temperature
	  in the unit was in the 90's, it was going to be a warm night!</p>
	  <p>For our first snorkel we buzzed down the road to Kahalu'u Beach Park. It
	  was strange being here again as Marjorie and I had visited this beach 
	  a year ago on our SF to Australia cruise. This
	  site is always good and we had a nice time. Saw lots of fish and a turtle. For
	  dinner we went to the Fish Hopper restaurant. It was very good. We ordered from an
	  earlybird menu and the meals were about 1/2 price. We had brought a number 
	  of games with us and played St. Petersburg for the evening. We retired for
	  a warm night as the A/C was still off.

        <h3>Day 2 (Sept 27) - Snorkelling at Honaunau</h3>

	  This morning I was up early (Calgary time!) and it was still dark. I had my breakfast out
	  on the patio as the sun rose. There was a bag of birdseed there so I filled up the
	  feeder and watched the finches and doves sate themselves. This was to
	  become a morning ritual for me. The 16th fairway of a golf course ran behind
	  the condo, so this was my view from the patio. Gorgeous! 
	  When the others arose, we headed down to 
	  Pu'uhonau o Honaunau for a morning snorkel. There is no beach 
	  there at all, you just hike over
	  black lava and climb into the water. The snorkelling was great. We came back to the 
	  condo for lunch. The mechanical guy showed up and fixed our air conditioning.
	  It turns out that there was an unmarked (and hidden) switch that activates all of
	  the A/C units. This is so that they can rent the condo "without air" for a cheaper
	  price. I really wanted air so had paid a bit more for the rental.</p>
	  <p>We decided to try out the main swimming pool. We had to walk across the
	  complex (30 buildings!) to the far corner. The pool was great. For dinner we 
	  drove to Honalo to our favorite Japanese food restaurant - Teshima's. Mrs.
	  Teshima was still going strong there at  95+ years old. After dinner we
	  returned to the condo and played Puerto Rico.

	  Today we decided to do the north end of the island. We headed up the 
	  lava covered Kohala Coast to Kauno'oa Beach. Along the way we encountered 
	  a few Ironman bikers and there were signs along the road to watch out for athletes.
	  We turned off the road at the Mauna Kea Hotel and got one of the few public beach 
	  parking passes from the guard house. The water was calm and the snorkelling 
	  was excellent. After our swim, we continued north and around the tip of the Kohala 
	  Peninsula to the King Kamehameha I statue at Kapa'au. We didn't go right to
	  the end of the road as we had been there before. We drove back along the
	  mountain ridge road (Hwy 250) and into Waimea (Kamuela). We had a very nice 
	  lunch at Merriman's.</p>
	  <p>On the way back to Kailua we stopped in at the King's Shops at the Mauna Lani
	  so that the kids could shop. Then it was back to the condo for a swim in the pool.
	  Monday's was tapas at the pool, so the kids had some finger food.
	  We had dinner at the condo and then played Amun-Re. Another perfect day!
	  Oh yes, and the A/C was working perfectly as well!

        After  having breakfast and feeding the birds, I turned on the news to see
		what was happening in the world. There had been a huge earthquake in
		Malaysia, and Hawai'i was under a tsunami watch. If a tsunami had been
		created (and they didn't know yet), it would hit Hawai'i at 1:10 PM. The news
		people said to listen to the TV or radio throughout the morning for updates.
		So, assuming this was not to be worried about, we headed off up the Kohala
		Coast to Pauoa Bay at the Fairmont Orchid.  We parked at the small lot
		for Holoholokai Beach and then walked about 1/2 km past the Fairmont
		Orchid to Pauoa Bay. The water was a bit murky and the snorkelling was just
		OK. When we got out of the water, the beach attendant told us that the
		tsunami watch was over. We walked through the hotel grounds to the hot tub
		and soaked for a while. When we got back to the parking lot, there was a 
		note on our windshield saying that they had locked the lot
		because of the tsunami threat. Sure enough, the 
		gate was locked and we couldn't get out. I had to walk over to the hotel to 
		phone for the security people to let us out.</p>
		<p>We returned to the condo and changed, then headed into Kailua for lunch 
		at Splashers (burger joint). The Rhapsody of the Seas was in port and several
		passengers were eating at Splashers. We did some grocery shopping at
		Safeway and then returned to the condo for a swim. We tried the smaller
		pool near our unit. It was very nice. Then it was home for dinner and an evening
		of Catan. We played an interesting board, so left it set up to play again
		the next day.

	  After sunrise this morning as I was feeding the
	  birds, the watering guy drove up the fairway. Every second day
	  he would come by in his jeep, attach the sprinkler heads and then return later to
	  remove them before the first golfers came through. He would always wave to me.
	  No one else up at this time I guess. We didn't go too far today. We decided to
	  do Kahalu'u B.P. again, just a few minutes down the road. As usual it was great.
	  In the distance we spotted the Pride of America cruise ship at anchor. We popped 
	  back to the condo to change and have lunch. </p>
	  <p>After lunch we drove a few minutes south to Keauhou Bay where we
	  booked the Fairwinds II catamaran for  a trip to Kealakekua Bay the next day.
	  I had done the trip twice before (Mike once) and we were really looking forward to it.
	  We returned to the condo for a game of Catan (same board as last night) 
	  and then a swim in the pool. We picked up dinner nearby at the L&L 
	  Hawai'ian BBQ fast food place in the Keahou Shopping Center. It was good.
	  Then we played Carcassonne for the evening.

	  at the dock in Keauhou Bay by 9:00 AM. The Fairwind II company no longer
	  does the door prize, so we didn't win another bag of Kona coffee (like last
	  time). The trip down the coast was sunny and smooth. Unlike the last two 
	  times when we sat on the top deck and got burnt to a crisp, we sat below in the
	  sheltered cabin. Much smarter! The snorkelling at the site was awesome. There
	  had been a land slide along the cliff about a year ago, so part of the 
	  snorkelling area was 
	  cordoned off. This was the area that had the best snorkelling before. However, 
	  the areas we could do were great. Didn't see many Achilles Tangs this time.
	  I think they were mainly in the cordoned off area. After the snorkel we had burgers
	  and drinks onboard, with people using the water slides and diving off the boat 
	  for some more fun. The trip back to Keauhou was cloudy.</p>
	  <p>We just had a lazy afternoon back at the condo. We went into Kailua for 
	  dinner at Bubba Gumps. Had a great meal there! The kids answered all
	  of the Forest Gump questions - I only knew the answers to a couple of them.
	  Back at the condo we played Tigris and Euphrates for the evening.

	  Got up early, had breakfast on the patio, watched the sunrise, fed the birds
	  and waved to the sprinkler guy. Boring! (But better than a good day in Calgary).
	  Stacy wasn't feeling up to snorkeling today, so Mike and I headed up the 
	  Kohala Coast to Hapuna Beach. It is a huge beach of lovely white sand. I
	  know a lot of people complain that there are no white sand beaches on the 
	  Big Island. They must have skipped the Kohala Coast. The snorkelling
	  was very good there. On the way back we saw the Sun Princess at anchor 
	  in Kailua. That's the sister ship to the Dawn Princess that Marjorie and I did
	  the previous year. I took a photo of the ship from the Wal-Mart parking
	  lot, exactly where I had taken the same photo of the Dawn Princess last
	  year.</p>
	  <p>In the afternoon we played Catan. Once again we enjoyed the board 
	  so left it setup for the evening. Then we did the swimming pool 
	  followed by dinner at Bongo Ben's in Kailua. On the way to dinner,
	  we stopped at Casa De Emdeko (where we had stayed twice before)
	  to watch the sunset. Back at the condo we
	  replayed the Catan board for the evening.

	  Today was our final day of peace and quiet before Chrissy and Matt arrived.
	  This morning a red cardinal visited with the other birds. That's the first one I 
	  had seen this trip. Then it was time for our daily snorkel.
	  C&M prefer swimming to snorkelling, so we had planned 
	  to do the "poor swimming but great snorkelling" beaches 
	  (or non-beaches) during the first week.
	  Hence we decided to repeat our trip to the Honaunau lava site. Once again the
	  snorkelling was very good. Parking is a bit of a squeeze, but if you get there
	  early, you can usually find a spot. After our snorkel, we took the one lane 
	  coastal route to Napo'opo'o, a little village just south of Kealakekua Bay.
	  We could see the Captain Cook monument across the bay and the area
	  where we had snorkelled from the catamaran. Then it was back to the condo 
	  for lunch.</p>
	  <p>Again, we had a lazy afternoon, with a swim in the pool. For dinner we
	  drove to Honalo and repeated at Teshima's. It's always good there!
	  After dinner we drove north to the airport to turn in our car and pick up M&C.
	  We traded the car for a 7 passenger minivan and then waited at the 
	  carousel for the 10:00 PM flight to arrive. C&M arrived safe and sound
	  and we transported them back to the condo.

	  As I was going about my morning ritual, I was surprised when M&C got up
	  relatively early. We did a walk around the condo complex. Nice in the early 
	  morning! When the others awoke we headed up the Kohala Coast to
	  Anaeho'omalu Beach by the Mauna Lani Hotel. It is a beautiful beach
	  with a large fresh water lagoon. However, this was our fourth time here
	  over the years and once again the snorkelling was crappy - far too murky
	  to see anything. We'll have to give up on this beach. So, we bundled up our things
	  and headed further north to Hapuna Beach. Stacy had missed this beach 
	  last week, so Mike and I were happy to repeat this beautiful beach. The
	  snorkelling was very good. M&C had a swim while the rest of us snorkelled.</p>
	  <p>On the way home we stopped at Splashers for lunch. The kids really like 
	  that place! In the bay, Carnival Spirit was anchored. We returned to the 
	  condo for the afternoon and had a good read. Then we did the swimming pool 
	  and watched the sunset from the pool. We had dinner at home and finished the
	  evening with a couple of games of Ticket to ride.

             <img src="images/diary_hawaii_0909/photo_hawaii_0909_49.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  This morning we decided to try Magic Sands Beach. I had never stopped there
	  before, even though we had passed it dozens of times over the years. It was
	  very wavey and there were lots of people with surf boards. We watched for a
	  bit and then decided to move down the road to Kahalu'u Beach Park. The
	  regular beach at K.B.P. is rocky and only good for snorkelling. However, there is
	  a second beach a short walk to the north that is sandy. We went in snorkeling
	  from this beach. It was very good. We went back to the condo to change and then 
	  hit the Kona Brewing Company (in Kailua) for an 11:00 AM tour. There was just one 
	  other couple there, so we were a small tour group. After touring the facility, we
	  sat in the outdoor restaurant area to taste some of their beers.  Afterwards we
	  stayed on for a pizza lunch. Very nice!</p>
	  <p>We returned to the condo and played some Ticket to Ride. We had a swim in 
	  the pool and then got ready for the luau dinner that Chrissy had booked for us.
	  Being Monday, there were tapas at the pool, but our luau date was for 4:30, so
	  we were too early to partake. Just as well - who needs two dinners?
	  The luau was at the Sheraton 
	  Keauhau Bay just down the road. Marjorie and I had
	  stayed there years ago when it was the Kona Surf Hotel. The luau was 
	  wonderful - good food, free drinks, and a great stage show. After the show
	  was finished, we drove back to the condo and played some Catan. A great day!

        <i>Note: This morning I could not find my camera bag (with my two cameras 
        in it). I could only think that I had left it at the Kona Brewing Co. 
        I phoned them to look out for it. Whah! Fortunately I still had my 
		underwater camera.</i></p>
	  <p>Today was going to be a long day. Our plan was to head up the Kohala Coast 
	  for a snorkel and then continue on over the saddle road and up Mauna Kea for 
	  the sunset. We thought that M&C would find Pauoa Bay nice for swimming, so
	  that's where we headed first. Once again the snorkelling was poor as the
	  water was very murky. There were lots of turtles there, so that made up for it.
	  After our snorkel we tried to go to the hot tub, but it was closed. So, we spent
	  an hour or so swimming in the hotel pool. May as well use the facilities! We
	  showered and changed at the Holoholokai Beach parking lot. This time
	  we were not locked into the parking lot! While we
	  were there, we stopped at the King's Shops so the kids could do some shopping. 
	  There was a second Merriman's restaurant there, with a different menu than 
	  the place in Waimea. It was good, but I think I preferred the other location.</p>
	  <p>We set off across the saddle road and up Mauna Kea. At about 9,000 ft we
	  stopped at the visitor's center for a while. There is a good museum there. Then 
	  we continued up the road to the summit at 13,000 ft. 
	  There are thirteen telescopes sprinkled 
	  over the mountain top. We bundled up and stood outside to watch the sunset.
	  It was cold! We headed back down in the dark and retraced our way back to 
	  the coast. We stopped again at the King's Shops (oh, those kids!) and then 
	  continued back to our condo. Had a bite to eat and then played some Catan.
	  An excellent day!

	  Today we had to say goodbye to Kona and travel around the island to Pahoa 
	  (near Hilo). This was to be our base for exploring the eastern side of the island.
	  After breakfast we packed our belongings into the van and headed south.
	  Just past Captain Cook we stopped at the MacNut Farms orchard where Marjorie
	  and I had visited in 2001. Then we drove down the hillside to Ho'ohena Beach 
	  looking for dolphins. We didn't see any, just some guys spear fishing. So we
	  drove back up to the highway. At Na'alehu we stopped at the Punalu'u
	  Bakery for a snack. That's the place that makes the coloured sweet rolls.
	  A little further along we stopped at Black Sand Beach (also called
	  Punalu'u) and saw a number of turtles on the shore and in the water.</p>
	  <p>We arrived in Pahoa by 1:00 PM and stopped at Luquins for lunch. What 
        a quaint little town! Then we drove a little further to locate our new 
        residence by the tide pools. We unloaded our stuff and then did a quick 
        snorkel before dark. <i>Note: I called Marj (as I did every afternoon) 
        and she had received a message from our Kona condo that my camera bag 
        had been found at the pool and turned in to security. That's when I remembered 
        taking the camera for a photo of the pool.</i> We played some sticks and 
        then the kids headed into town for dinner. I was still full from lunch 
        so didn't go with them.

	  Today was cloudy with a chance of rain. For all those sunny days that we had 
	  been blessed with in Kona, it had rained heavily each day in Hilo. We were 
	  hoping that we brought the good weather with us. It was time to visit the
	  volcano. Heading to the main highway, we saw a small farmer's market and 
	  stopped in. They had some produce and fruits as well as handicrafts. We
	  also found a shave ice stand and each had a snow cone.Yummy! Then we 
	  continued to the volcano park. Things had changed since Mike and I were 
	  there last. About a year ago an active vent had opened up in the main Kilauea 
	  crater sending a plume of smoke and gases up and southward. As a result, 
	  part of the encircling road had been closed. You could only now drive a "C" 
	  shape of the road. We did the Jagger Museum and the Thurston lava tubes.
	  We took a break and had lunch at the Lava Rock Cafe.</p>
	  <p>It poured in rain as we had lunch. After lunch, the rain stopped and we 
	  drove down the Chain of Craters Road to the end of the road. In the
	  distance we could see the smoke plume where the lava was pouring into the 
	  sea. We also did the hike to Pu'u Loa to see the petroglyphs. From the
	  park headquarters we found that the best viewing was from the Kalapani 
	  end of the road, not far from our Pahoa rental. So, we went back home for a 
	  bit and then headed to Kalapani as darkness came. However, when we got
	  there the site was closed "due to an emergency" that we never did find out
	  about. We drove back through Hilo and stopped at Pescatores for dinner
	  at about 8:00 PM. We'd have to try the viewing site again tomorrow.

             <img src="images/diary_hawaii_0909/photo_hawaii_0909_66.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  This morning I discovered 2 bicycles in a storage room. I was missing my
	  birdfeeding routine, so I hopped on the bike and went for a spin around the
	  subdivision. It was great. When I got back to the house, Matt was up, so we 
	  both went for a spin. Then it was time to get the others and head off for the day.
	  We stopped first at the Mauna Loa Nut factory. They had a large gift shop 
	  and an interesting self guided tour of the factory. The orchard is enormous - 
	  row after row of macadamia nut trees. Then we toured the town of Hilo,
	  pointing out the Dolphin Bay Motel where we had stayed twice before.
	  Then we did the waterfall tour - Rainbow Falls, the Boiling Pots, Pe'epe'e 
	  Falls, Akaka Falls and Hakuna Falls. We stopped in the little town of
	  Hakalau for pizza at Liz's.</p>
	  <p>After lunch we headed back to Hilo and had an ice cream. Then it 
	  was back to the house for a swim in the tide pools. Towards dusk we 
	  once again headed to Kalapani  and the volcano viewing site. This
	  time it was open and we hiked 1/2 mile or so to the viewing area.
	  From there we could see the lava pouring into the ocean and the huge 
	  plume of steam, smoke and gases billowing upward. It was awesome. 
	  As the darkness came the cloud glowed redder and redder.
	  Absolutely amazing! Walking back over the lava we used our 
	  LED headlamps.
	  They sure came in handy. We drove back  through Pahoa and picked up
	  asian food on the way. Back at home we had dinner and then played 
	  some Catan.

	  Today was our final day. We packed up our bags, loaded the van and headed 
	  out for Kona, this time doing the northern route across the island. Our first stop
	  was at the Hilo ice cream shop for some shave ice. It was closed! Oh no!
	  As we headed up the east coast, we detoured off the highway to a vanilla 
	  bean farm. The girls bought some vanilla pods so that they could make some
	  homemade flavouring. Then we continued on to Waimea. We were planning 
	  on stopping at Merriman's for lunch. It was closed! This wasn't our day!
	  We instead had lunch at Huli Sue's. Just on the edge of town we saw the
	  Tropical Dreams farm where our favorite ice cream from Kaua'i was made.</p>
	  <p>Today was the actual day of the Ironman competition, so lots of roads
	  were closed around Kailua. We had to drive down the belt road to our
	  previous condo so that I could pick up my "lost" cameras.  We had a number
	  of hours to kill before our evening flight, so decided to see if we could get near to 
	  the Ironman finish line. We did, and saw a number of the athletes arrive at the
	  finish. It was a blistering hot afternoon - how can they do that? After standing 
	  in the heat for a while we decided to go back to our old condo for a swim.
	  The pool gates weren't locked and the friendly guard waved us through the gate,
	  so we spent an hour or so cooling off in the pool. After our swim we
	  drove back to Honalo and had dinner at Teshima's. Then it was time to
	  work our way through the road closures and back to the airport. Our
	  flights were on time, getting us into Calgary the next morning. It had
	  been a wonderful trip. Now it's time to plan for Maui!
