      <p><b>Day 1: </b>I have actually described the turnaround day in the previous 
        diary. We essentially spent the morning changing rooms, and then spent 
        the afternoon with D&J walking around Venice. </p>
		
      <p><b>Day 2:</b> This was actually our third day in Venice and was the only 
        day we did an organized tour. Today was rainy and quite cold. We had breakfast 
        and then headed out for our ship's tour at 8:15. D&J joined us for the 
        tour. A boat picked us up at the ship and took us to Piazzale Roma. From 
        there, we walked to the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, a baroque building 
        on a large square. Then we walked on to Santa Maria Gloriosa Dei Frari, 
        a beautiful church just around the corner from San Rocco. Then it was 
        on to the Rialto Bridge. We didn't stop at the Rialto market, so that 
        will be for another trip. Finally we hiked on to S. Marco square. It was 
        dry but cold now. After some time wandering the S. Marco area, we boarded 
        a boat which got us back to ship by 12:45. We had lunch then headed 
        to the tournaments - mini-golf (Marjorie got 2nd) and shuffleboard (Marjorie 
        and I got 2nd). The muster drill at 3:15 and we set sail at 4:00. We went 
        up to the Cruise Critic M&G, but few people were there. Most were out 
        watching the sail away. We had dinner at the Polo Grill. I had the surf 
        and turf. Our evening trivia team was still mostly intact, as our teamates 
        were also doing the B2B. We won. Woohoo!

      <p><i><b>Note: </b>I checked the passenger count today and there were 1182 
        passengers - about 50 less than the previous leg.</i></p>
		<p>So, we were on our way to our fifth visit of Dubrovnik. The locals would 
        probably recognize us! The weather forecast was for cool and rain, but, 
        as we wouldn't be arriving until noon, there was lots of time for that 
        to change. We had breakfast and then spent the morning doing the tournaments. 
        We bundled up for the weather. The wind was blowing so strong that the 
        mini-golf balls were blowing around, and even the croquet balls were moving 
        in the wind. The co-ordinator ended up cancelling the events and giving 
        everyone <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O Points</font> for showing up. We 
        had lunch as we were pulling into the Dubrovnik docking area. We docked 
        in exactly the same place we had docked just 4 days ago. The Shah of Oman 
        was still docked there with his huge private yacht.

	  <p>Once again we
	  had no tour planned. We were going to find an internet cafe to check our
	  emails (and send one) and then walk the city walls. Which is
	  exactly what we did. The amazing thing was that as we headed into the old town on the shuttle bus, 
	  blue sky broke out. The the afternoon was hot and sunny. Beautiful! We found a nice internet
	  cafe along a narrow "restaurant" street, then headed for the wall. We really enjoyed walking
	  the wall - the views are fabulous. They had changed the access though. We used to pay a guy 
	  right on the stairs up to the wall for our ticket. Now you have to go to a special office to get your ticket.
	  The entire length of the wall is just over a mile, so you can do it in an hour or so 
	  depending on how fast you walk and how many photos you stop to take!
	  After the walls, Marj rested while I toured through the Domincan Monestary. 
	  We could hear a band playing in the distance and walked over to see it. It was a
	  local band set up near the market area. Our wall ticket also included
	  entrance to Lovrijenac Fortress, just outside of the old town. We decided to pay it a visit.
	  It was quite a climb up to the fort but well worth it.
	  We caught the shuttle bus back to the ship about 5:00 PM. Dinner was in the main dining room and I 
	  had lobster thermador. Once again we won evening trivia. Woohoo!

      <p>The port of Kotor was not only a new port for us, but a whole new country. We had never
	  been to Montenegro before. We were up early to watch the ship dock. Kotor is in
	  a small fjord with mountains all around. Beautifu! It was cloudy with a bit of rain in 
	  the early morning, but it cleared up later and was a wonderful sunny day. We had breakfast
	  and then headed off to our 8:15 tour (with D&J). Heading out of town, we drove up a switchback
	  road (25 hairpins!) to 6,000 ft. We stopped at a lookout for a beautiful view of city and coastline. 
	  Then we drove through some mountain valleys to the village of Njegusi where we stopped for 
	  a snack - bread, cheese, proschuito and beer. We had some time to wander through the village
	   and then headed on to the larger town of Cetinje. This was the first capital of Montenegro 
	   (before it was moved to Podgorica) and the home of the royal family. We visited the palace that
	   was the home of Prince Nicholas I, the last ruler on the throne. Then we drove back a different
	   route that looked down over the coastal town of Budva, where the wonderful beaches and 
	   expensive hotels were. Back at the ship we entered the old town for a walking tour. It 
	   is quite a small town, so the tour went quite quickly. We were back on the ship by 2:00 PM for a milkshake
	   and afternoon trivia. We had dinner at Jaques. I had the shrimp and scallops. Wonderful!
	   We finished the day with evening trivia.

      <p>So, this was the first real disappointment of the cruise. Being our 3rd time in Corfu and having
	  done most of the tourist stuff, we had booked a ship's excursion by ferry to a National Park in
	  Albania. We had never been in Albania before. However, there were problems either with
	  the tour operator or the visa process which caused Oceania to cancel this tour. Waaaaa!
	  On the bright side, it was a gorgeous cloudless sunny day. Hot in fact! We had breakfast
	  and then joined in the mini-golf tournament. Then we wandered off the ship and took the 
	  10:00 AM shuttle to old Corfu Town. We walked around the old town (knowing our way from the tour
	  one week ago) and bought Milko, olive oil and some kumkuot jam. 
	  We got a bit twisted in the curving alleyways and
	  exited the town to an unfamiliar area. However, we could see the ship and decided to walk to the
	  ship rather than trying to find our way back to the shuttle bus. We were back to ship by 12:30. 
	  It was hot!! We had lunch (pizza and milkshake) then played shuffleboard and afternoon trivia. 
	  We ate dinner at the Red Ginger. I had rack of lamb with a wasabi crust. Afterwards it was
	  evening trivia - we won again.

      <p>Monemvasia was another new port for us. However, we weren't going to see much of the local 
	  village as we had a full day tour planned to the center of the Peloponnese Peninsula. It was a
	  sunny warm morning as we anchored in the harbor. We ate breakfast while the 
	  tender boats were lowered and launched.
	  Our bus tour was at 8:30 and D&J were going with us. It was about 1.5 hours to drive to Sparti. We did
	  a photo stop of a monument to the ancient Spartans. There isn't much left from the old city. Then
	  we drove 10 minutes or so to Magoula, to a restaurant for a quick drink and pee break. Finally we
	  drove a bit further to Mystras, our final goal. It was 11:30 by this time.There we walked through the ruins
	  of Byzantine churches and other buildings. It was a "modern" site (modern for Greece) being built
	  in the 13th century and occupied through to the mid-1800's. One of the old churches was especially 
	  interesting, with the remains of beautiful frescoes. It was really hot climbing the trails as
	  it hit a high of 33 degrees!  After about an hour of traipsing the ruins, we hopped in the bus and headed back to the 
	  restaurant in Magoula.

	  <p>We had a nice lunch served with wine and fruit juices. We were on the bus at 
	  3:30 and back to the ship by 5:00. The temperature on the coast was much cooler than inland - about
	  7 or 8 degrees cooler. The local village looked very interesting - we would have to walk 
	  around it if we ever get back here again. For dinner I had lamb rack at Toscana. We were really enjoying
	  the four specialty restaurants and the price was right (free)! Once again it was evening trivia and
	  we were fortunate enough to win again.</p>
	  <p>We had been asleep for an hour or so when I was awakened by a load noise outside. Our 
	  clock radio showed midnight. I opened our balcony door and there was a helicopter hovering 
	  right above our balcony. We were on a deck that sticks out further than the decks above, so we 
	  could look straight up. Man, was it loud! We had been through 2 medical evacuations by helicopter
	  on two past cruises, so we knew exactly what was happening. The process took about half an hour
	  and the helicopter finally swung away and disappeared into the distance. The captain announced
	  the next day that the passenger made it safely to hospital and was doing fine. Me, I'd rather be on
	  the cruise ship!

      <p>Rain and cool were now a distant memory as we woke up to another beautiful sunny day.We had
	  breakfast as we docked in Agios Nikolaus on the huge island of Crete (Kriti). This was our first time to
	  this island - our 19th Greek Isle. We had a half day ship's tour booked
	  to visit the ancient site of Knossos with D&J. Knossos was the home of the mythical King Midas and
	  the horrible monster - the Minotaur. The majority of the ruins we were to see were built during 1700 to 1400 BC
	  (middle Bronze Age) and deserted around 1300 BC. Like Pompeii and Ephesus, Knossos is one of those 
	  places you just have to visit! We boarded the bus at 8:30 and drove for 1.5 hours 
	  through the countryside - passing through Malia and Herakleion on our way to Knossos. There
	  are several extensive ruin sites on Crete, the third largest being in Malia. However, Malia wasn't 
	  on the schedule. We
	  arrived at the archaeological site of Knossos about 10:30, got our tickets and walked to the ruins.
      <br clear=right>

      <p>The Minoan ruins were amazing. Some areas where still under excavation, 
        while other areas had reconstructions done by earlier archaeologists. 
        It was fairly crowded, but we had 1.5 hours to see everything and it really 
        is a small site. It was quite hot at the site with little or no shade. 
        By noon we had finished, so reboarded the bus for the trip back to the 
        ship. We should have arrived back in Ag. Nikolaus by 1:30, but about 15 
        minutes from the port our bus broke down! It was about half an hour until 
        a new bus appeared to pick us up. So, we arrived at the ship about 2:00. 
        We had a quick lunch (pizza and milkshake) and then wandered back into 
        town. The temperature had settled to about 21 degrees - sunny but cooler 
        than yesterday. Our first stop was at an internet cafe to check our email. 
        Then we popped into a grocery / souvenir shop and bought some "Crete" 
        beach bags for the kids and some packaged spices (for Greek salad and 
        tziziki). The store owner was a friendly lady from Ireland! She had married 
        a Greek fellow and moved to Crete. We wandered around the harbor and then 
        reboarded the ship in time for afternoon trivia - we won again. Man, I 
        really know how to pick trivia team mates! For dinner we did the main 
        dining room and I had shrimp. Then we played evening trivia with the usual 
        result. <br clear=right>

      <p>Today was a gorgeous day - sunny and hot. We were up early and having breakfast as we anchored
	  off of the main island. We were supposed to have stopped close to the Port of Athinios to disembark those
	  passengers on bus tours and then relocate to Skala for the independent passengers. However, the ship
	  headed directly for Skala. We were serviced by local tenders, some going to Port Athinios and some to 
	  Skala. We had breakfast and then did the mini-golf tourney. We were in no hurry as we had nothing booked 
	  for the day. On an earlier visit to Santorini, we had been captivated by the village of Oia, so we planned
	  to take the local bus to Oia and spend a couple of hours walking around the village. We tendered to port and 
	  ascended via the gondola (4 Euro) up to Thira. It was a short walk to the bus station. The bus to Oia leaves
	  every half hour, but we climbed into a waiting bus and got the last two seats. It was 1.6 Euro for trip to Oia.
	  The road north was windy and twisty and took about half an hour. We parked just outside the village
	  (which is pedestrian only).

	  <p><i><b>Personal Note: </b>To me, Oia in the sunshine is like walking in 
        a fairyland - it is certainly the most beautiful village in the world! Everyone
		should visit here once in their lives.</i></p>
		<p>We wandered 
        Oia for 2 about hours only stopping for a quick lunch - buns and Coke 
        that we had brought with us. The beautiful white buildings stood out against 
        the sunny blue sky. Gorgeous! There were lots of visitors in town, but 
        it didn't feel crowded. Leaving the village, we caught the bus back to 
        Thira and once again lucked out with a bus that was just leaving. We did 
        a bit of shopping in Thira (Milko for Marjorie and some placemats for 
        the kitchen table). Then we started down the donkey trail. Man, was it 
        hot!!! We squeezed through a herd of donkeys at the top of the trail then 
        concentrated on not stepping in the donkey poo all the way down the trail. 
        We walked along the dock in Skala to the tendering site. We were back 
        on the ship in time for afternoon trivia. For dinner had lamb chops in 
        the main dining room. As usual we played evening trivia and did well - 
        OK, we won. What a wonderful day.

      <p>We woke up to another warm sunny day. Today was Kusadasi (again) and, having done all the usual
	  tours before, we had joined a private tour to Izmir. However, the organizer was not able to get enough
	  people for the tour and canceled it. The ship didn't offer this tour either, so we decided to have a
	  "day at port". We were up to watch the docking and then went for breakfast. Having a casual
	  morning, we joined the mini-golf and croquet tournies. It was really hot out, but we decided to brave 
	  the heat and go for a walk around the town. We visited a mosque that we hadn't been to before 
	  (Hatice Hanim Mosque) and wandered through the souvenir and carpet shops just off the
	  main street. We were back aboard the ship in time for lunch (pizza and milkshake!). Afterwards
	  we completed our daily grad slam by joining the shuffleboard tourny. Then we left the ship again 
	  and walked around the docking area looking at the other ships (Crystal Symphony was there).
	  There was a wonderful folkloric show at 5:00 PM featuring several Turkish men and women doing
	  traditional dances, with music provided by accordian and drums. For dinner  (in the main dining room)
	  I had lobster tail. It was very good. This was our final evening trivia and we finished it with a win!
	  We also got the bonus <font color="#FF0000">BIG-O Points</font> for being the winningest team
	  for the week.

      <p>Today we were supposed to visit Delos in the morning and Mykonos in the afternoon (we had an
	  excursion booked for the afternoon at 1:30). However, May 1
	  is "Labour Day" in Greece and the workers at the Delos archaeological site were going to be on
	  strike. Hence, we wouldn't be able to tender at Delos. Instead we would be arriving at Mykonos early. This was fine
	  by us as we have done Delos twice before. It was too bad though for all the first timers to Mykonos / Delos as
	  it really is an interesting site. It was another nice sunny day. We had breakfast and then
	  did the croquet tourny. At about 10:00 AM we arrived at Mykonos and anchored in the harbour.
	  We had an early lunch and then tendered in to town. The sea was quite choppy.  The ship was running 
	  both local tenders (large) and ship's tenders (small).  People returning on the small tenders were complaining
	  about being tossed by the waves. We lucked out and got a local tender which did just fine in the chop. 
	  D&J got delayed getting to the tender and instead got a small tender.
	  We were ashore by 12:30. We waitied for D&J and then had an hour to explore Mykonos before the tour.
	  During our time on the island we saw no activity at all related to Labour Day. It was business as usual.

	  <p>We walked through Little venice and up to the famous windmills. We were back to the tour meeting place
	  by 1:30. All of the previous times we had been to Mykonos we had only toured Mykonos Town. This time
	  we decided to do a tour that took us (and D&J) out and around the island.
	  It was a 15 minute walk to the bus parked on the edge of town. From there we drove to 
	  Agios Iannnis for photo stop. The village was on a small peninsula. Beautiful hotels and homes there.
	  Then we drove to Ano Mera in the center of the island. We visited the
	  old monastery of Panagia Tourliani. At a nearby restaurant we were served a snack of bread, 
	  cheese, proschuito, and bitter!! olives. Those were the only olives ever that I have not been able to eat.
	  We took the bus back to Mykonos Town by 3:30. We decided to walk through town again, then tender 
	  back for 4:30 PM.  Once again we lucked out and got a large tender. Back onboard, we went to the
	  Big-O cashin - we had about 120 points. We bought a t-shirt for D&J, a couple of tee's for ourselves 
	  plus a couple more unbrellas. Never know when it's going to rain!
	  We had dinner in main dining room. I have no idea what I had for dinner. It's not that I had 
	  something that I didn't know what it was, but rather that I had just forgotten what I had. 
	  There was no evening trivia
	  tonight. Instead our entertainment was packing our bags and placing our suitcases out in the hallway.
	  We did a final wander through the ship then went to bed.

	  at 8:30 AM. Our drive to the airport was south along the coast, bypassing busy Athens. We passed the Olympic
	  village along the way. We had a couple of hours to kill at the airport, but our flight to Frankfurt was on time,
	  leaving at 1:40 and arriving in Frankfurt at 3:45. We had a very tight connection at FRA as we left for Toronto

	  delayed about 1/2 hour, leaving at 11:30 and getting us into Calgary at 1:30 AM!! 
      Earlier in the day C&M had dropped off the new kitties at our house, picked up our car and parked it at the airport.
	  It took us a while to find the car, so we arrived at home after 2:00 AM. All was OK. It was hard to believe that just
