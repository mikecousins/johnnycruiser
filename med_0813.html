    <p>We chose this cruise because it included 5 ports that we had never been
	to before, especially the Balearic Islands. Also, we do love the Freedom Class ships.
	We had done the Freedom and the Liberty before, but never the Indy. Also
	it was a pretty good price. When we first booked the cruise there were only 7
	ports. However, a couple of months before the cruise they announced an itinerary
	change adding Gibralter. Score! Another new-to-us port!! </p>
	<p>To justify the air expense and the wicked time zone change, Marjorie booked 
      us on a preceding <a href="ireland_0813.html">bus 
      tour of Ireland</a>, so this cruise was actually part of a larger holiday 
      trip. Because we were dragging bags around Ireland, we decided not to bring formal 
	  clothes. Marjorie had a nice dress and I brought a tie and sweater. That
	  would have to do. We had to bring a selection of wear anyways, as Ireland was cool 
	  and rainy while Spain would be hot and sunny.

       <h3>Day 1 (Aug 23) - Arriving in Southampton</h3>

    Rewinding a bit (if you're continuing from the<a href="ireland_0813.html"> 
    Ireland diary</a>), we had a noon flight over from Dublin, arriving in Heathrow about
	1:30. After grabbing our bags and going through customs, we did the tunnel thing to
	the Central Bus terminal. It's a long hike! Marjorie was able to get us on the next departing 
	bus to Southampton (3:00 PM), and return tickets for 8:00 AM. Both legs were fairly optimum too, 
	without a lot of extra stops. At 3:00 we boarded the bus and drove around the airport stopping 
	at terminals 4 and 5, picking up additional passengers. Then we headed southwest 
	for Southampton. We just had one more stop in Winchester. We hit an accident along the 
	way so the going was quite slow. We finally reached the Southampton bus station by
	5:30, about a half hour late.

	<p>Marjorie had booked us at the new quayside Premier Inn. It happened to be just
	a couple of blocks from the bus station,and in the direction of the cruise terminal. The
	hotel was very basic, but was adequate and brand new. After checking in and dropping 
	our suitcases in the room, we headed out for a night on the town. It was only a 5 minute
	walk over to the new  WestQuay shopping mall. We did a quick tour through the new
	mall. Then we went through the Bargate to the tourist area and 
	found a pub for dinner. Fish & chips, of course. On the way back to the hotel we stopped 
	in at a Tesco for two 6-packs of Coke and some juice for Marjorie. Then it was back to the 
	hotel for an early night.
	<p><i><b>Note:</b> There were a number of huge rhinoceros 
	(97 in all) sprinkled through 
      the city, all brightly coloured. It was the same deal as the Calgary cows 
      we had a few years ago. The event was sponsored by the Marwell Zoo.</i>

        <h3>Day 2 (Aug 24) - Boarding in Southampton</h3>

    <img src="images/diary_med_0813/photo_med_0813_06.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      We were up about 7:30 on a cool overcast day. We packed our stuff ready for the cruise
	  and then headed out for breakfast. There was a Marks & Spencers in the nearby mall, so
	  we ate in the cafeteria. It was a good breakfast. My electric razor had packed it in while in
	Ireland, so we popped into John Lewis where I bought a European (240V) Phillishave
	for BP 30. I can use it for all our Europe trips now, plus on the cruise ships. No need for 
	an adaptor or converter now. We were back to the hotel by 11:00, checked out, and
	walked about 2 blocks to the cruise terminal. Wow, the hotel was really conveniently placed!
	We did the checkin thing at the terminal and then boarded the ship. I was a bit worried
	about carrying on Coke, as liquor was being confiscated, but I got through security just
	fine. It could have just as easily been a 12 pack of beer as no one checked.  Having just been on
	the Liberty (sister ship) everything was familiar.  We had lunch in the Windjammer (buffet)
	and headed to our cabin at 1:00. Our bags arrived shortly after so we unpacked (finally, 
	after two weeks!). We wandered the ship for a while and then went to the 4:00 muster drill.
	At 5:00 we did the Diamond Club free booze party up on deck 14. This would be available 
	to Diamond members each day for the entire cruise. Woohoo. Dinner was at 6 PM where
	we met our tablemates - a couple from Vancouver with their 15 year old son and his friend.
	We wandered the ship some more after dinner and then back to the cabin for an evening read 
	and early to bed.

        <h3>Day 3 (Aug 25) - A day at sea</h3>

	<img src="images/diary_med_0813/photo_med_0813_08.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290">
     Today we slept in until 7:00 AM. It started off cool and overcast, but 
      as we headed south it warmed up and the sun came out. We had a leisurely 
      breakfast, as our first appointment for the day was the Cruise Critic Meet 
      & Greet party at 10:00 on deck 14. It wasn't a very large group at all which was 
      expected as very few people had chatted on the message boards. I don't think 
      we met anyone there that we even saw again during the cruise. No one had 
      arranged any private tours, so we didn't have any excursion mates to meet 
      either. So much for CC! For lunch we did the now 
      famous salad bar lunch in the dining room. This is the best lunch ever, but 
      only available on sea days. At 3:00 we joined the progressive trivia throng 
      and teamed up with a wonderful couple (John & Bev) from Norwich. (By this 
      time we had discovered that Marjorie and I were the only two people aboard 
      who weren't British). Being sports minded, we called our team the "Flaming 
      Canaries". The first quiz typified our results for the remainder of the 
      cruise, finishing somewhere in the middle (or so I like to think). Then 
      it was time for the gym. Row, row, row your boat! Tonight was formal night 
      and we dined again with the Vancouverites, reminding us that there were at 
      least 6 Canadians aboard. I think I mentioned earlier that I didn't bring my 
	  formal wear. I wore a tie and a sweater. No one was offended at our table 
	  as the father and the two boys were all wearing jeans! I had shrimp and 
	  crab ravioli. Very Good. We wandered 
      the upper deck for a while and then retired to our cabin. <br clear=right>

        <h3>Day 4 (Aug 26) - Our first time to Vigo</h3>
      </center>
    <img src="images/diary_med_0813/photo_med_0813_09.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
    <img src="images/diary_med_0813/photo_med_0813_10.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
     We woke up at 7:00 AM to a hot and sunny day. (28 degrees). We were in Vigo,
	 which we had never been to before. Spain is an hour ahead of Britain, but Portugal
	 is not. Because we were going to be in Portugal tomorrow (Lisbon) we did not have
	 to turn our clocks ahead for just one day. Hence, our ship's time was not
	 the same as local Vigo time. We did breakfast in the buffet and then 
	 grabbed our backpack and headed to the theatre for our 9:30 excursion. We
	 debarked and boarded a bus for a tour of the city of Vigo (pronounced "Bee-go").
	 The "Tour de Spain" bike race was occuring at this time and Vigo was hosting 
	 it today. We were warned that there might be traffic upheavals because of this,
	 but there were no sign at all of the competitors. They must have left earlier.
	 Our first stop was on a nearby hilltop at a fortification called Monte del Castro,
	 built in 1665.
	 We had about 45 minutes to walk around the walls with great views of the city and
	 harbour. There were some beautiful gardens, fountains and sculptures within
	 the grounds. Then we reboarded the bus and headed south along the coast.

    As we drove through the countryside, our guide explained that the small village 
    we were heading to (Valenca) was actually in Portugal. That was great news
	as the cruise only had one stop in Portugal (Lisbon) and it was nice to see
	a bit more. We drove through the 
    town of Tui (Spanish) and then crossed a river that defined the border between 
    Spain and Portugal. The guide pointed out where there used to be a border, 
    but now there was nothing (thanks to the EU). Valenca was on the south end 
    of the bridge. The town turned out to be two small villages stuck together 
    - one outside the city walls and the other one inside.  After a walking tour of the village(s)
	we were given 45 minutes to wander. We stopped at a souvenir shop to buy a
	table cloth. The clerks didn't speak any English, so it was fun playing charades 
	and trying to describe "rectangular". The cloth we got was excellent quality and 
	fits our two tables perfectly. We drove back the same route and arrived at the
	ship about 2:00. Marjorie tried the free Wi-Fi on the dock  and got a fairly good
	connection, so we could read email and send out our status. As we boarded
	the security people confiscated our port, but we were expecting that. We'll get 
	it back at the end of the cruise. The ship set sail at 3:30. I went to the gym for
	a 7.5k row. Felt good! For dinner I had the roast beef. We did the evening
	trivia, but skipped the entertainment.
	<p><i><b>Note:</b> Our son Mike 
    had asked us to get him a bottle of Taylor 20 year port. There was a liquor 
    store in Valenca that had exactly that for Euro 40. We took a chance and bought 
    it knowing that we would pass several liquor stores in Lisbon the next day. 
    When we did check a few stores in Lisbon, they were all more expensive! How 
    often does that happen? </i>

        <h3>Day 5 (Aug 27) - Lisbon, Portugal</h3>

      Today was forecast to be sunny and 31. We were up about 7:00 as we sailed up the Tagus River into Lisbon.
	  It rekindled memories as we passed the Belem Tower and the Navigator's Monument, as well as
	  sailing under the Salazar Bridge (oops, they hate him so renamed the bridge to "25 de Abril").
	  On our previous visit  to Lisbon we had done a comprehensive tour of Lisbon, so this time we were doing
	  a trip out into the countryside. We had breakfast and then headed to the theatre for our 9:00 tour.
	  We boarded the bus and then headed north, along the Atlantic Coast to the village of Cascais
	  (pronounced as Kash-Kyshe). It was a bit hazy or foggy close to the water. We were given 45
	  minutes to wander about the town. It was interesting as a seaside town, but there didn't seem to 
	  be anything historic here other than a small fortress built in 1488.
	  A good portion of the oceanside walkways were tiled in a pattern
	  that made the surface look warped. The visual effect was so strong that I felt I was going to stumble. 
	  Wierd!! We stopped at a small grocery store where I bought a bottle of cheap 
	  local beer to take aboard. Hopefully it wouldn't get confiscated. Reboarding the bus we
	  continued our tour.

	  Our next destination was inland and up a mountain to the hilltop village of Sintra. The
	  fog cleared as we climbed the mountain and the blue sky enveloped us. This was
	  a much more interesting village with cobbled streets and old buildings. It was very hilly
	  with most streets seeming to go up. We had a walking tour of the "old town" and
	  then were given 45 minutes on our own. After a bit of a wander,
	  Marjorie and I found a lovely courtyard 
	  behind a church that was shady and had a wonderful view. We sat there in the quiet and
	  had our backpack lunch - muffins and a Coke. We had wrapped the Coke in a towel 
	  along with a baggie of ice and facecloth. It was still icy cold! Then we reboarded 
	  the bus and headed back to the ship. We were on the ship by 2:00 and the security folks
	   ignored my beer. Score!  I went to the gym about 3:00 and then we attended trivia
	   at 4:30. Our dinner was at 6:00 each night and we developed a daily routine of going to
	   the Diamond lounge for our free drinks at 5:55 and carrying them down to the dining
	   room to have with our dinner. I usually got a beer and Marjorie a rose wine.
	   Tonight I had scallop linguini. Excellent! The entertainment was a comedian /
	   vocalist impersonator and was wonderfull, very talented. He did a better
	   Neil Diamond than Neil Diamond. Our clocks went forward tonight.

        <h3>Day 6 (Aug 28) - We finally get to Gibraltar</h3>

      Today was Gibraltar! I have always wanted to go there and this was added to our itinerary
	  a month before sailing - just like magic. We were up at 7:30 and had breakfast at 8:00. It looked nice
	  outside with a forecast for 31 degrees.  Because of the distance from Lisbon, we wouldn't reach 
	  Gibraltar until 3:00 PM, so this was sort of like a sea day. We had our second progressive trivia 
	  session at 10:30, and I went to the gym at 11:30. For lunch we did the salad bar in the dining room.
	  We went up on deck as we traveled through the Straight of Gibraltar and headed for
	  "The Rock". Our tour was at 3:15. Our bus was a small one with about 20 passengers.
	  We started with a tour through part of the city. There
	  were British and Gibraltar flags everywhere, probably related to the recent tensions
	  with Spain. We passed a monument to the great evacuation in WWII which lasted
	  until 1951. We stopped at the base of the rock at a cable car station.

    Our whole busload jammed into one cable car and we sailed up to the top of 
    the rock. What a view! At the top there was a restaurant / souvenir shop, 
    a lookout platform and monkeys. Well, technically they aren't monkeys, but 
    Barbary Apes. Apes have no tail. We had about half an hour to check out the 
    360 degree view of Gibraltar City, the airport and part of Spain. Then we 
    hopped back in the cable car and went half way down the rock. We exited the 
    gondola and walked a short distance to the "apes den". There were a few apes 
    there and I had the honour of having a small one jump onto my backpack (on 
    my back)! Before Marjorie could shoot a photo, the guide ran over and chased 
    the ape away. A teenager with us had the same experience but toughed it out
	so that we could take pictures. Then we drove a short distance to the entrance 
	to some tunnels. The tunnels were constructed starting in 1782 and were
	extended in each war since. Most recently, they were used in WWII and during
	the cold war that followed. The tunnels were deliciously cool and we were given 
	about half an hour to check them out. We actually needed more time to hit
	every nook and cranny. There were lots of cannon and mockups in various 
	caverns that showed how they were used. As our time expired, we headed
	out back into the heat and reboarded the bus.

	   We drove the rest of the way down the rock and stopped at a museum. It
	   was about 5:30 by this time and the museum closed at 6:00. So we rushed 
	   through the exhibits which were actually quite interesting. Lot's of naval
	   history! Leaving the museum, we drove along the western coast 
	   to the southernmost tip of the peninsula
	   where there was a lighthouse and a large mosque(the Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque)
	   that was donated by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. We had a short stop to look around 
	   and then drove up the eastern coast, thereby circumnavigating the rock. As we 
	   approached the ship we passed the huge lineup of cars waiting to cross the
	   boarder back into Spain. Work to rule! We were back on board by 6:30. We
	   were too late for our fixed seating dining, so went to the anytime dining area
	   and begged to be let in. They let us know they weren't happy about it, but
	   did allow us in. There were lots of empty seats in the dining room because
	   of our 8:00 PM sailing time, so the hassle was really just about  prepaid tips.
	   Big deal!! I had atlantic cod. Very good. We were a bit delayed and sailed
	   at 8:45. We skipped the entertainment.

      After three ports in a row it was nice to have another sea day.  We slept in a bit
	  and rose at 7:30. We did the dining room buffet breakfast (deck 4) and sat with
	  some Scots and  a couple of Irish ladies. Maybe not everyone on board was 
	  from England. Our first appointment was progressive trivia at 10:30 (in
	  the Pyramid Lounge). Once again 
	  we were very average. For lunch we did our favorite salad bar thing in the dining
	  room. After lunch we read our books for a while. At 3:15 we had reservations for the
	  ice show. However, as we were waiting for the show to start, they had problems 
	  with the automated lighting so had to cancel the show. We were rescheduled to
	  September 3 (another sea day). So, Marjorie read while I hustled off to the gym.
	  It was dressup night so I donned my tie and sweater again. Our regular dinner 
	  mates had warned us that they were going to the specialty restaurant tonight,
	  so we would be alone. So, as we carried our drinks from a raid on the Diamond
	  Lounge, we pleaded with the maitre'd to put us at another table for the evening.
	  Once again they weren't happy, but did take us to a table for 8 that had just 6 diners.
	  The table was almost next to our regular table (but a different waiter).
	  It turned out that the two vacant seats were assigned to real passengers, but they 
	  had never shown up. It was a lively table of oldsters and we had a great time with them.
	  I had shrimp on rice. The entertainment was a comedian who was very good. He
	  talked a mile a minute and was very funny.

    Today was Valencia - the home of Santiago Calatrava (who designed our controversial 
    <i>Peace Bridge</i> in Calgary). He has created a number of architectural 
    wonders in <i>The City of Arts and Sciences</i> in Valencia. Since seeing 
    photos of his buildings, I have wanted to see them up close. We were up at 
	7:00 to watch the sail in . Unfortunately the day was overcast, so pictures
	were going to be poor. We had breakfast and then headed to the theatre for our 8:15 tour.
	We boarded the bus and  started a driving tour of the city. Before long we
	were at <i>The City of Arts and Sciences</i> and we were given about half 
	an hour to walk around the magnificant buildings. The bulk of the area was a
	knee deep pool of water and the buildings rise out of the water. It is certainly
	a multi-use area with an Imax theatre, planetarium, laserium, concert hall, 
	sports complex, museum of science, oceanographic aquarium, opera
	house, gardens and more!

    Then, it was back in the bus  as we drove to the old part of the city to visit the Fallas Museum.
	 We debarked and had a short walk to the museum. Background: Every year there
	 is a Fallas Festival where people create lifesize images (ninots) of people  doing various
	 activities.  At the end of the festival, the images are burned. The ninots (gigantic cardboard, 
	 wood and plaster figures) that are spared from burning every year by popular vote are on 
	 display in this museum. Its collection is made up of all the figures that have been spared
	 since 1934. Also on display are posters of the Fallas Festival and 
	 photographs of related subjects. We were given about half an hour to wander
	 through the museum and photograph the ninots. I did not get the titles of
	 the various displays, so I have posted a few of the photos with my own
	 descriptions.

    After we finished up at the Fallas Museum, we reboarded the bus and drove 
    to the old part of the city. There we headed off on a walking tour of the 
    old town. It was still overcast so the lighting wasn't the best.  Our route took
	us by a town hall, some Moorish buildings, the Valencia Cathedral and the 
	Serranos Gates, and a produce market. The market was in a huge building 
	with many rows of vendors' stalls. There were veggies, meats, fruits and 
	even some handicrafts. It was an amazing market. We also learnt the 
	difference between a Valencia orange (sour) and a Seville orange (sweet).
	The Valencia oranges are used mainly for marmalades and jams. We were 
	back to the ship by 1:00 PM. We had lunch and then went back out onto the 
	dock looking for free wireless. No luck! We read for a while then I went up
	to the gym to try to move the ship. Our regular dinner mates were back for dinner.
	I had braised spareribs which were a bit overcooked. We skipped
	the entertainment.

    We have been to Barcelona several times, and have done a 3 day stay in a hotel, 
    so yes, it was like coming home. Having done most of the local city stuff, 
    we decided that we would head out of town to the Monserrat Monastery. We had 
    breakfast at 7:00, then headed off to our 8::00 AM tour. It was sunny and 
    warm today - no overcast like yesterday. On the bus, we first did a quick 
    tour of the city. Then we turned northwest and drove through the countryside, 
    about 1 hour to Monserrat. Along the way were orchards of olive trees and
	in one of them I spotted an ostrich. 
	As we approached the Monastery we drove up a craggy 
    mountain to 4,055 ft elevation, to the site of the Monastery buildings. 
    It was a huge site with a small town, tourism buildings and even a small grocery 
    store. In the background was the huge Monastery. There were buildings way 
    down below us that could be reached by a funicular, and buildings way above 
    us reached by another funicular. We had a narrated walk from the parking area, 
    along the main street and into the Monastery courtyard.

    The courtyard was huge and led up to the cathedral. We went inside the cathedral 
    and queued up to go upstairs to see the <i>Black Madonna</i>.  I thought that this
	was a unique icon, but looking on the Web there are 450 to 500 Black Madonnas
	in Europe (paintings or sculptures). This one is from the 12th century and is housed
	in a balcony over the alter of the cathedral. Going upstairs one passes in front of the 
	madonna, within about 3 feet. Turning around 180 degrees provides a second story 
	view of the cathedral from the balcony. Going down another set of stairs took us to
	a side entrance that let us out into another courtyard. From there we walked back 
	to the souvenir shops and the more secular side of the complex. We were given an 
	hour to walk around the area on our own. We browsed through the souvenir shops
	and the grocery store, but didn't buy anything. Then we discovered a cobbled
	hiking trail the lead off to another small church about half a mile away. The trail 
	had a slope to it so that we soon had an excellent view of the monastery from 
	above. Along the trail were monuments and sculptures, one of which was for 
	the famous cellist Pablo Casels. I didn't realize that he was from this area. We 
	didn't make it all the way to the church but stopped at a small park to eat our lunch 
	(muffins and Coke). There was a beautiful view of the valley from there.  The
	serenity of the spot was really nice.

    On the
	way back down the path we stopped at the two funicular terminals to check out
	times and prices. We didn't have time to do either trip as we had to be back to the 
	bus soon. We walked back along the main street to the bus stop and
	 reboarded the bus. We took a 
	different road back down the mountain and part way down saw a Nunery in the distance.
	Finally we were to the bottom of the mountain and headed back to Barcelona. Again, it 
	was about  an hour's drive. It had been a marvelous tour and we really enjoyed the 
	monastery and surrounds. As we drove back I kept my eyes open for the ostrich, and 
	spotted a group of them. I mentioned it to our guide and she said that ostrich farms 
	were popular here. So, I wasn't going crazy! 
	We were back on the ship by 2:00 PM.  I headed up to the
	gym to wear off my muffin and Coke, then returned to our balcony to read for a while.
	For dinner I had shrimp and sea bass. We skipped the entertainment (again!).

        <h3>Day 10 (Sep 1) - Our first time in Mallorca</h3>

      Overnight we had left the Spanish mainland and travelled to the Balearic Islands.
	  This morning we arrived in Palma de Mallorca. It was our first time in the islands. It was a hot
	  and sunny day again.
	  We were up at 7:00 and had our breakfast in the Windjammer. Then we were
	  off to the theatre for our 8:15 tour. Once on the bus, we did a quick tour through the
	  city and then headed off to the village of Valdemossa. This village was made
	  famous when Fredryk Chopin spent a few months there in 1838, hoping to recover from 
	  tuberculosis. He was shacked up with George Sands (actually Amantine Lucile Aurore
      Dupin). We did a walking tour of the town, including the monastery where Chopin and
	  Sands lived. The original room has been furnished with period furniture and Chopin's 
	  piano. We were given an hour to walk around on our own and enjoyed the cobbled
	  streets and interesting buildings. We got back to the bus stop early and had our usual
	  snack - muffins and Coke. Then it was on to the bus and driving back to Palma.

	  We were back to the ship by 1:00 PM. We had lunch in the buffet and then took the
	  shuttle bus back into the city. We spent close to an hour walking around the magnificant 
	  cathedral. Unfortunately we couldn't go inside as it was Sunday and they had services 
	  every hour. Then we walked along the main avenue to McDonalds to try their
	  free Wi-Fi. It worked fine so Marjorie did her business stuff. Then we walked back to the 
	  shuttle bus and were back on the ship by 4:00 PM. I went to the gym for a quick row.
	  Our dinner mates had warned us that they were going to the specialty restaurant, so
	  we went directly to our "second family" table. We had a great time with them. I chose
	  the roast beef and it was very good. We skipped the entertainment.

     This was our second day in the Balearic islands as we headed to Ibiza. Once
	 again this was a new port to us. And the warmth and sunshine was continuing.
	 Our tour was at 9:30, so we had lots of time to watch us arrive and have breakfast.
      Upon boarding the bus we did a tour through the main part of Eivissa (the main 
	  city if Ibiza) and headed up a hill to "high town". This was the original walled
	  city from medieval times. We parked just outside the walls and were led on
	  a walking tour inside the walls. Our tour finished at the cathedral where we were 
	  allowed in for some photos. The cathedral was built in the 13th century. We were given
	  some time to walk around on our own. Being on the top of a hill meant that the streets 
	  went up and down, nothing on the level! It really was a beautiful little town. Then
	  it was back to the bus again. Now we headed off north across the island to the 
	  village of Sant Miquel where we would visit the Cave of Can Marca.

     We parked at a restaurant / souvenir 
    shop and picked up our local guide. We were quite high up and had a beautiful 
    view over a small bay. We walked down some 300 steps to the entrance of the 
    cave system. The cave consisted of several small caverns with a highlight 
    water show (with coloured lights) at the end. It was very interesting, but 
    nothing like the giant caves we had seen in Postojnska, Slovenia. Then we 
    had to climb the 300 steps back up again! Boarding the bus, we drove east 
    across the island to the seaside village of Santa Eularia des Riu. We were 
    given about an hour to wander around the village and along the beach. Marjorie 
    and I did the beach walk and then took refuge on a shady bench by the flea 
    market, where we performed the ritual of the muffins and Coke
	(backpackers' communion). We were back 
    to the ship about 2:15. It was a great tour - very enjoyable! It was sunny 
    and warm so we read our books out on the balcony. I did the gym thing around 
    4:00. For dinner we joined our alternate table and I had shrimp tagliatelli. 
    We did the evening trivia but skipped the entertainment.

    After 4 ports in a row, it was time for another sea day. Weather? Hot and 
    sunny! We were up at 7:30 and had a long breakfast (until almost 10:00). We 
    were sitting with some very interesting people. Our progressive trivia attempt 
    at 10:30 proved once again that we were very average people. Just as we finished
	the final question and before marking the papers, an announcement came to clear the 
    Pyramid Lounge (where we were) for a medical evacuation. (The helipad was 
    right above us.) So we grabbed our answer sheet for future marking and hustled 
    up to the pool deck to see the helicopter come. This would be our fifth medivac 
    over our many past cruises. The helicopter was from the Salvamento Maritimo 
    (Spanish Maritime Safety Agency) and would be taking the patient to a
	hospital in Alicante. The deck was packed with people and the 
    bulk of the activity was out of sight at the front of the ship. However, they 
    played a bridge camera view on the giant screen over the pool. I think the 
    patient had a broken leg. We skipped lunch and went instead to our 1:00 PM 
    ice show that had been postponed from several days ago. It was excellent. 
    Then we attended a future cruises talk (Marjorie likes those) at 3:00 and 
    "Where in the world am I?" trivia at 4:00. Once again we joined our alternate 
    dining table (regular mates AWOL again). I had rack of lamb - the first time 
    lamb was on the menu - and served with real mint sauce. Some waiters sang 
    for us as we ate so we skipped the later entertainment. Evening trivia was 
    at 7:45. <br clear=left>

    This would be our second time in Cadiz. The previous time here we did a full 
    day excursion into Seville. This time we opted for a shorter tour to two "white 
    villages" out in the country. We woke up at 7:00 and watched our arrival at 
    Cadiz. Once again it was a sunny warm day. We had breakfast and then packed 
    for our 9:15 tour. We started with a tour through Cadiz city and then headed 
    southeast along the coast. After about an hour we arrived at the hill upon 
    which the village of Vejer de la Frontera is perched. 
	We stopped at a restaurant at the base 
    of the hill for a pit stop and then ascended the 222 meters (700 ft) to the 
    village. We parked and then did a walking tour of the village.  Once again
	the streets were all on hills so lots of up and down. Pretty well all of the
	buildings were painted white - hence the term "white village". We were
	given a half hour to walk around on our own. Then we marched back 
	down to the bus for our next adventure.

	We drove back down the hill and then over to the ocean. Then we headed
	 northwest along the coast. We passed the famous point where the Battle 
	 of Trafalgar was fought (Lord Nelson). A bit further we arrived at the "white" 
	 village of Conil de la Frontera. This town was right on the ocean and didn't
	 seem to have any historic buildings. We weren't given a tour at all, just a half 
	 hour to walk around on our own. Marjorie was looking for a shop selling t-shirts
	 but there were none! No one wears t-shirts in Spain? We drove back to Cadiz
	 and were on the ship by 2:30. I went to the gym for a workout. Afterwards
	 I went up to the sports deck to watch the radio controlled car races. This 
	 must be new to RCL. Tonight was formal night so I broke out the tie and 
	 sweater again. For dinner I had shrimp and lobster. They did the
	 trooping of the cooks right around dessert time. We played 7:45 trivia and
	 then checked out the entertainment. It was a weird string quartet (jumping
	 all around), so we didn't stay. Clocks back one hour tonight.
    <p><i><b>Note of interest:</b> 
    At tonight's trivia, Marjorie and I played as a team of two while our 6 alternate dinner 
    mates were on the other side of the lounge as another team. We saw them, but 
    they were unaware of us. When the scores were tallied up, there was a tie 
    for first place - us and them. At that point they saw us and started to boo 
    us. We thumbed our noses back at them. (All in fun, of course!) The girl running 
    the trivia said "I sense that there is some history between these teams". 
    M and I won the tie breaker question (about London) and so we had to rub it 
    in to our Brit friends.</i>

    <b>Day 14: </b>Our trip was now down to two final days at sea. We were heading 
    north, so each day was a little bit cooler and cloudier, getting us ready 
    for Southampton. The first day we were up at 7:30. Progressive trivia was at 10:30. 
	We started by marking the sheets from two days ago (medivac interuption!). It
	was amazing how the scores were elevated from the norm! However, after the 
	next quiz we were all back to normal again. We did the salad bar lunch in the 
	dining room. Our second ice show was at 3:15. On this cruise there were two 
	completely different ice shows, and both were very good. For dinner I had mixed grill
	(lamb, beef and chicken) as we sat with our regular mates. Evening trivia was
	at 7:45 and we skipped the entertainment.
	<p><i><b>Note:</b> We were wandering around the promenade deck today and I 
      was looking for the double hulled lifeboats for tendering, but I couldn't 
      find any. I stopped one of the officers and asked why. He said that the 
      ship never tenders as all ports have docks. In the Caribbean where this 
      isn't the case, local tenders are used (we did that on the Freedom). </i> </p>

	 and Marjorie was really good at id'ing the aircraft. I think we got 18 out of 20. Then
	 it was time to pack our suitcases. When we returned to our room, the steward had 
	 returned our bottle of port, safe and sound. We wrapped it well and put it into one 
	 of the suitcases. For dinner our regular mates weren't at the table. 
	 They were always there before us, so we assumed that they were dining elsewhere
	 and joined our alternate table. About 5 minutes later they showed up. Oops! Oh well,

	wonderful adventure -  <a href="ireland_0813.html">
	Ireland</a> and Spain.  We were up at 6:00 and had an early breakfast. We grabbed 
	our suitcases and were off the ship by 7:00. We grabbed a taxi and drove the short 
	distance to the bus depot. We were there early and had a bit of a wait for our 8:00 bus.
	The bus was ontime and we arrived at our Heathrow terminal at  10:00 AM. We checked
	in and had an hour or so wait in the general seating area until our gate was assigned.
	Then we went through security and waited a bit at the gate. Our 1:30 flight was ontime
	and direct to Calgary. We arrived in YYC at 4:30 and Matt was there to pick us up,
	all dressed up fancy and looking good (during an intermission in a wedding ceremony).
	We were home after 5:00. Everything was fine and the kitties were happy
	to see us. Another
	wonderful holiday!
