      <p>We booked this trip on the Celebrity Equinox about a year and a half before the sail date.  We were 
	  interested in trying the new ship, and the itinerary included mostly places we hadn't been to before.
	  Especially intriguing were Israel and Egypt. I was so interested in Egypt that I signed up for a course at
	  the U of Calgary in the Spring about Egyptian hieroglyphics and religion. I wanted to be prepared!</p>
	  <p>The Equinox is identical to the Solstice, which we had done earlier in the year in the Caribbean. We
	  just loved the Solstice, so were eager to see the Equinox. We weren't disappointed.</p>

       <h3>Day 1,2 (Oct 19,20) - Travel to Rome</h3>
      </center>

      <p>We were fortunate to get an afternoon flight to Rome - no early morning start!
	  We dropped Fluffy off at the cat kennel at 9:00 AM. Then we finished our packing and waited 
	  for the airport shuttle. It came at 11:00 AM. There was another pickup on the way, so we got to the 
	  airport just before noon. We checked in and had a short wait for our 1:00 PM flight to Toronto. At 
	  Toronto, we met our cruising buddies Barry and Heather from Hamilton. We had cruised 
	  with them twice before. We had another short wait and were off to Rome by 8:30 PM. The 
	  plane was a 767 and only about 1/3 full. Marjorie was able to grab the 3 middle seats next 
	  to us, and I had the window/aisle combo. It was great having all the extra room. Still, neither 
	  of us really slept much on the trip.</p>
	  <p>We arrived in Rome about 8.5 hours later, just before noon. We had an email from the hotel 
	  that we were booked on their complimentary airport shuttle and to phone for instructions 
	  when we arrived. 
	  Marj did so and was told that we weren't booked for a shuttle! We ended up getting a ride 
	  on a generic airport shuttle right to our hotel. It was 15 Euro each, but was worth it. When we 
	  arrived at the hotel and showed the email, the hotel gave a feeble excuse about us maybe 
	  being late for the 12 PM shuttle. Yeah, right!</p>
	  <p>The other problem we had was that there are 3 Alimandi hotels within a couple of 
	  blocks, all at different addresses. 
	  The airport shuttle dropped us off at the one where we had booked (3 star), but the hotel had
	  "upgraded" us to the unit a block away (4 star). Now we would have to get hold of the 
	  shuttle company we had booked for the transfer to Civitavecchia and let them know of our 
	  address change. Lots of fun!

      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_03.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>We checked into the hotel by about 1:30 and spent rest
	  of the afternoon wandering around the 
	  Vatican area (and the Castel Sant'Angelo monument). It was blue sky and warm, so I wore 
	  my shorts. I was the only one I saw in shorts, with most people bundled in sweaters and 
	  jackets. Roman wimps! Our hotel was right across the street from the Vatican Museum entrance, 
	  so it was very convenient. We wandered around the large plaza in front of St.Peter's
	  Basilica. It was relatively crowded with tourists.Then we walked 
	  beside the Pope "escape tunnel" to the Castel Sant'Angelo museum. This building was
	  originally built as a mausaleum for the emperor Hadrian, but had been modified trhough the
	  centuries and served as a prison for a while. There were lots of street vendors 
	  selling purses and other things.</p>
	  <p>On our way back to the hotel we stopped at a couple of "fast food" pizza places 
	  for pizza and gelato. A great way to start an Italian holiday! We were back at the hotel 
	  at 6:30 trying to stay awake so that we could attempt a normal night's sleep (although we
	  had  
	  been up for 2 days!). We lasted to 7:30 and then had to crash. So, we both woke up at 11:30 PM 
	  thinking it was morning. No such luck. I got up and did my diary, then went back to bed 
	  around 2:30 AM.  I went to sleep again which was good as we had an early start for the next day.

        <h3>Day 3 (Oct 21) - First Full Day in Rome</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_04.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_05.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>It was a beautiful sunny day. We both went back to bed at 2:30 AM, but still woke up at 6:00. 
	  Breakfast opened at 7:30 AM, so we had to wait an hour or so before we could eat. Breakfast 
	  was included at the room rate. It was a pretty good variety and was a good start to the day. 
	  We had prebooked a Vatican Museum / Sistine Chapel tour through Viator Tours. We were to 
	  meet at 9:30 at the steps just across from the Vatican Museum entrance. Well, by fluke, our hotel 
	  was right beside the steps. We just walked out the door of the hotel and there was our tour group! 
	  We did a 3.5 hour tour through the various rooms (palaces) and hallways and courtyards all 
	  stuffed with paintings, sculptures and tapesteries. The complex is made up of numerous papal 
	  palaces, all linked together. It was amazing (and huge). The highlight were the Rafael rooms 
	  and the Sistine Chapel (Michelangelo). The guide was very good and we certainly learned a lot 
	  (mostly now forgotten). In one of the 
	  Vatican courtyards, there was a "broken sphere" sculpture by Pomodoro.
	  Earlier this year we had seen another of his spheres at Trinity College in Dublin. I still had the
	  photo of the Dublin sphere on our camera, so I showed it to the guide. She was surprised!</p>
	  <p>After the tour we returned to the hotel to pick up our backpack. We headed out for an afternoon 
	  on our own.  We stopped at a nearby restaurant where I had shrimp scampi and Marj had lasagne.
	  Then it was time to start our cathedral tour. I had looked up some interesting cathedrals and we 
	  were going to attempt to visit 3 of them.
      <br clear=right>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_06.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290">

      <p>We had decided to do all our travel by subway. We entered the nearest 
        metro station and bought an all-day pass (4 Euros). We travelled across 
        the Tiber river and over to Republica Square station. From there we walked 
        to <a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-santa-maria-maggiore">Santa 
        Maria Maggiore</a> Cathedral, founded in the 4th century AD. It was enormous 
        and full of wonderful paintings and sculptures. All the cathedrals here 
        are marvelous. Then we walked back to the Termini station and continued 
        down to the Colleseum station. We walked to <a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-san-clemente">San 
        Clemente</a> Cathedral. This is a smallish 12th century cathedral built 
        on top if a 4th century cathedral which in turn was built on top of a 
        1st century Roman village. We went down steps under the cathdral to the 
        earlier cathedral, and then down more steps to the roman village. All 
        levels were intact and it was very interesting.</p>
		
      <p>We then walked over to <a href="http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/rome-san-giovanni-laterano">San 
        Giavonni in Laterno</a>, another huge cathedral. I had picked these three 
        cathedrals from a book I have on Roman architecture and they were all 
        really worth a visit. By this time it was after 6:00 PM and we had had enough 
        walking for one day. We subbed it back to the Octaviano station (closest 
        to our hotel). Walking back to the hotel we stopped at a kebab place for 
        dins. It was after 7:00 by this time so we just watched some TV, read and 
        then packed it in for the night.

        <h3>Day 4 (Oct 22) - Second Full Day in Rome</h3>
      </center>

      <p>It rained overnight and was supposed to rain all day. 
	  We couldn't complain though as we had had 
	  two beautiful days already. We had linked up with some other cruisers (6 of us) on Cruise Critic 
	  and booked a private tour for the day. We had to hop on the subway over to Republica Square 
	  and meet the others at a hotel on Via Modena at 9:00 AM. 
	  We left extra early so we would have plenty of time (at least a half hour) to find 
	  the hotel in case we got lost. Although the hotel was only 1.5 blocks from the train 
	  station, we got lost! We had the 
	  address and asked a number of people (including a military guy and a bus driver) where we 
	  should go and got various answers, none of which lead us to our destination. Two
	  people even said they had never heard of the street. Our map didn't 
	  have all the streets on it, so that didn't help either. On our wanderings we were stopped by some 
	  military guys and out from a gate came some soldiers on horseback, looking just like the 
	  Buckingham Palace guard. Cool! I finally sorted the map out and we arrived at the hotel exactly 
	  at 9:00.

	  <p> Our wandering must have taken us about the full half hour. Anyway, the other
	  folks were there waiting and we boarded a minivan. We drove about 20 miles 
	  east of the city to a village called Tivoli, 
        where the <a href="http://www.villadestetivoli.info/storiae.htm">Villa 
        d'Este</a> and <a href="http://sights.seindal.dk/sight/901_Hadrians_Villa.html">Hadrian's 
        Villa</a> were situated. Our first stop was at the Villa d'Este. This 
        is a huge mansion and gardens with hundreds of fountains that was built 
        in 1551 by a Cardinal who received the land as a consolation for not becoming 
        the Pope. We walked through the building and gardens. Dispite the rain 
        it was very nice. Just to make things more wet, there were fountains everywhere. 
        Apart from a fountain near the top of the slope, all of the fountains 
        were powered by gravity. The water was diverted from a nearby river. One 
        of the founatins was called the "organ" fountain and actually played music 
        on the hour. We just missed the timing, so didn't get to hear it. After 
        an hour or so of wandering the gardens we met back at the minivan for 
        our next destination.

      <p>We were 
	  scheduled to visit the nearby summer villa built by the Emperor Hadrian. However, it was 
	  raining hard and the guide didn't think it would be worthwhile in the rain. So, we skipped 
	  the tour of Hadrian's Villa 
	  and returned to Rome. We got back about 1:00 PM and the group
	  went to a nearby restaurant for 
	  lunch. I had gnocchi, and Marj had an egg and artichoke pizza. After lunch we 
	  said goodbye to our tour mates and metro'ed it back to the hotel. The rain had stopped 
	  by now so we headed over to the 
	  Vatican to visit St. Peter's Basilica. There was a long lineup to get in, but we had nothing 
	  else pressing so joined the line. It was probably ony about 1/2 hour wait and then we toured 
	  through the basilica. We had toured it the last time we were in Rome (2006), but enjoyed the 
	  second time through. It really is an amazing church.</p>
	  <p>Then we returned back to the hotel around 
	  6:30 or so. After resting a bit, we popped over to the local grocery store to get some supplies 
	  for the cruise - Coke, beer, juice, chocolate basr, snackies. 
	  It is always fun shopping when you can't understand the 
	  labels and people speak Italian! The largest  package of Coke I could find was a 6 pack.
	  We've noticed this all over Europe that no one stocks 12 or 24 can packages. The beer came in 
	  2 packs, so I got some Peroni and some Moretti. Now we were set for the cruise.

        <h3>Day 5 (Oct 23) - Boarding in Civitavecchia</h3>

      <p>Today was transfer day. Our pickup time for the shuttle to the cruise dock was for 10:40 AM. 
	  So, we slept in a bit and had a leisurely breakfast. Then we did a walk down the street looking 
	  for an ATM. We needed some Euros for the upcoming excursions. We checked out from the 
	  hotel just as the shuttle had arrived. I had prebooked a shuttle for 6 people a couple of months 
	  ago, and got 4 other passengers from Cruise Critic. One of the couples was from North Vancouver.</p>
	  <p><i>Aside: When Marj originally booked the hotel, the web said 160 Euros. They booked us at 175. Marj 
	  complained and they sent an email stating our price would be 160. When we arrived at the hotel (a 3 star) 
	  they had rebooked us into their 4 star hotel (a block away) as they were overbooked in the 3 star.
	  They said there would be no upgrade charge as they were moving us at their discretion. Fair enough!
	  However, when we checked out, they charged 175. When we showed them the email that stated 160, they
	  reminded us that we were upgraded ... Rather than fight it we just paid the 175 (times 3 nights!)</i></p>
	  <p>The trip to Civitevecchia was about 1.5 hours. It was still cloudy, but we had a bit of sun along the way. 
	  We got to the cruise port right at noon. There were already lots of passengers checking in. 
Checkin went very quick and we were onboard the ship by 12:15. We dumped our carryon in our 
cabin and headed up to lunch.The ship is identical to the Solstice, which we did in February. So, 
we had no problem finding our way around. We saw some familiar crew faces around the ship as 
many of them had trained on the Solstice and then moved to the Equinox in August. We even ran 
into Carl, the Corning Glass Museum guy, who we had had lunch with on the Solstice. He said he 
remembered us. We're really looking forward to seeing some more glass blowing.

<p> Lunch was 
great - they have the same sandwich bar as the Solstice - I had egg salad!
After lunch we toured around the ship, then visited the library to pick up some books to read. 
We read for a bit and it was time for life boat drill (at 5:00). The drill no longer requires life jackets. We 
just sat in the theatre and watched a safety movie. Then it was time to get ready for our first dinner. 
We had early seating. Celebrity came out with "select" dining (anytime) a couple of months before
the cruise, but we opted to stay as fixed seating.
Our Ontario friends (Barry and Heather) had arranged a table for 8 with another 
couple from Vancouver (Dave and Louise) and a couple from Florida
(Ron and Beverly). The group seemed very compatible, so we 
should have some great dinners together. Early dinner is at 6:15 (late!) and we didn't finish until 
almost 8:30. We decided not to do the entertainment (which was at 9:30), so just wandered the 
decks. We went to bed about 10:00 and actually slept through until 7:00 AM.

      <p>Today was a day at sea. We woke up to cloud and rain, and it was that way throughtout the 
	  day. It was cool, too. We had breakfast at 7:00 (there was no one there!) and then wandered around 
	  a bit. I visited the gym for a workout while Marj read her book. After a cool down period (and some 
	  Corner Gas), we went to the Cruise Critic "meet
	  and greet" at 10:40. There were mobs of people there. 
	  We met some old friends, some virtual friends and others that we hadn't met before. It was nice 
	  finally meeting those folks that we had booked excursions with and chatted for a year or so on 
	  the Web. Lunch was in the buffet. I had my usual egg salad sandwich. Great!</p>
<p>After lunch we browsed the ship a bit more and then did some reading. At 4 PM (every day) there 
is an open bar for Elite members in the Sky Lounge. We wandered up there but didn't see anyone 
we knew. This is a new perk in the Celebrity loyalty program. This competes with the free minibar 
setup offered by Princess. Then we headed back to our cabin to get ready for formal night. It was 
rack of lamb night! After dinner we headed to the show in the theatre. It was a Cirque de Soleil type 
show with lots of high wire and acrobatics. Excellent! We had seen a similar show on the Solstice. 
Then, we were off to bed.

        <h3>Day 7 (Oct 25) - Corinth (Piraeus)</h3>
      </center>

      <p>Today was our first port stop - in Pireaus, Greece. We had done lots of Athens last year, so 
	  had joined a private group to visit Corinth and Mycenae. We had done 
	  Mycenae before, but not Corinth. It was another cloudy, rainy, cool day. We
	  were not used to this weather 
	  in Greece! We docked about 10 AM and headed off the ship with our group of 12 passengers. 
	  Our planned itinerary was the Corinth Canal, ancient Corinth, Mycenae and then Menea. However, due 
	  to the torrential rain and thunderstorms, we weren't sure how far we would get.</p>
	  <p>Corinth was about an hour out of Athens. We passed over a bridge over the canal and 
	  stopped just at the end of the bridge (at a restaurant and souvenir shop). 
	  It was a narrow bridge with sidewalks on either side. 
	  The near sidewalk was impossible as the roadway had several inches of water and every 
	  car sprayed the sidewalk with gallons of water. So, we crossed the road and walked out the 
	  dryer sidewalk. We took some photos looking down the canal. The narrow gorge was 90 metes 
	  high, so boats would not see anything but walls. Unfortunately there were no boats when we 
	  were there. Then we headed a few miles away
	  to the site of ancient Corinth (Greek, then Roman). 
	  We did the museum and then part of the grounds. It rained hard at times, so we didn't do 
	  the whole site.

      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_19.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_20.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      <p>Heading towards Mycenae, we stopped at a roadside cafe and had some pizza for lunch. 
	  Then we continued on to Mycenae. We had done this last year in the sunshine, so Marj 
	  decided not to join the trek through the site. I did and it was interesting, even though we 
	  didn't do the whole site and it rained most of the time. Our tickets included an entrance to 
	  the burial mound down the road, so as we only had purchased one ticket, Marj got to go 
	  to the "Tholos", also known as the Treasury of Atreus. 
	  However, the security lady at the entrance felt sorry for me and eventually 
	  waved me through to join the rest of the group.</p>
	  <p>Due to the weather and traffic, we decided to skip Menea and head back to the ship. 
	  Even so, we weren't back until 5 PM. It was an interesting but very wet day. It was nice 
	  to be back in our warm and dry cabin! For dinner I had a tasty steak (New York, maybe?). 
	  Afterwards Marj headed back to the cabin but I went to the entertainment. It was a 
	  singer / trumper player. I didn't care for him, but he was a real live wire and the crowd 
	  loved him. He got a standing ovation.

        <h3>Day 8 (Oct 26) - Rhodes, Greece</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_21.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_22.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      <p>Today was our stop at the island of Rhodes. Rhodes is probably most noted as the
	  headquarters of the crusaders during the 4th Crusade. We woke up to another forecast of heavy 
	  rains and thunderstorms.That's 5 rainy days in a row! The weather was definitely following 
	  us as our guides in both Athens and Rhodes claimed the day before was wonderful. In fact, 
	  Rhodes boasts 300 days of sunshine a year, and we had to get the rainy day! Oh well, I'm 
	  sure we're just paying for the previous 8 years of sunny cruising that we have enjoyed
	  in the past!</p>
	  <p>Once again 
	  the ship had a late docking at 10 AM. Our tour for the day was organized by our good friend 
	  Glenys from Sydney. She had booked 4 cabs (4 pax each) to drive us through the old town 
	  and then to the hilltop fortress of Lindos (almost an hour away). We did some  rainy stops 
	  in the old town for "the view". It's amazing the difference between scenery and architecture 
	  against a bright blur sky amd the dreary look of cloud and rain. It really is a beautiful island, 
	  but you just have to imagine how it would look in the sunshine. Our first stop was at the 
	  dockside Church of the Annunciation (built in 1929). The highlight stop was at the Palace
	  of the Grand Master, built in the 1300's. It is a huge fortress now traversed by traffic.
	  Then we headed south down the west coast.
	   <br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_23.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_24.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>Along the coast we stopped 
	  at a gold jewellery factory. No one was really interested, so we didn't stop long. When we 
	  got to Lindos it was pouring with lots of thunder and lightening. We were let off in the small 
	  village at the foot of the hill. I joined a small group who 
	  braved the 250 steps up to the fortress, with rivers of water running down the path. We really 
	  couldn't appreciate the ancient structure in this weather, and the views of the ocean and 
	  beaches were bleak and dreary. While I was up the hill, Marj rambled around the village,
	  including a stop at the Church of Panagia. This church was build about the year 1500.
	  After a stop of about 1.5 hours, we jumped back in the 
	  taxis and headed back to the ship. Along the way we stopped at a ceramics factory and 
	  the sun peeked out!</p>
      <p>We got back to the ship about 3:00 PM. I headed to the gym and Marj wandered. Elite 
	  members have an open bar from 4 to 6 (I think
	  I mentioned this before). Other than a brief visit 2 days ago, we haven't 
	  used it yet. Free booze and we're letting it pass? Dinner was great. I had 
	  the osso bucco. Very good! The entertainment was a variety show, but very late (9:15), 
	  so we didn't attend. Instead we went to the hot glass show. Oops, it was raining - no show.

        <h3>Day 9 (Oct 27) - Kusadasi, Turkey</h3>
      </center>

      <p>We woke up today to sunshine! We were back to beautiful Turkey. Kusadasi is a sea 
	  port and vacation spot. We had booked a private tour to Ephesus and Sirence through 
	  Glenys and Alan. It was also our first early excursion. Our previous dockings were at 10 AM, 
	  today our excursion left at 8 AM. We had an early breakfast and then headed out to meet up 
	  with the tour. Marj and I were the first ones out, so I was talking to our guide from Ekol Tours. 
	  I mentioned that our guide three years ago was Bekir,
	  also from Ekol. Our guide pointed to the fellow 
	  next to him and asked me if he looked familiar. It was Bekir! What a coincidence. We boarded 
	  a 24 pax van (there were 16 of us) and headed off to Ephesus. I asked the guide if we could 
	  stop at the ocean overlook on the way (ie. in the morning sun) 
	  as the lighting would be better on the ship (the usual 
	  stop is at the end of the day when the sun is behind the ship). So we got some pictures
	  of the ship in perfect lighting. We arrived at Ephesus about 1/2 hour later. It was nice to see 
	  the ruins again although it was a first time for Marjorie as she was sick the last time we visited.
	  This time we did the terrace houses which we had skipped last time.The weather was 
	  great. Not a cloud in the sky, but not too hot either. There were crowds of people at the site, 
	  but it is very large. Difficult to get pictures without people in them. We even caught a gladiator 
	  show on the ancient street.

      <p>After Ephesus, we headed to the village of Sirince (shi-RIN-ja). It is a hillside town with 
	  narrow cobbled pathways (no traffic!). It used to be a Greek town, but was resettled by Turks
	  when the mass migrations happened in the 1920's. 
	  There were lots of souvenir shops, handicrafts and wine / olive 
	  oil shops. We wandered up and down the alleyways and visited an old church (St. 
	  John the Baptist) under reconstruction. Marjorie bought a bottle of "Simza" olive oil.
	  Back on the bus, we stopped at a leather factory and outlet. 
	  I don't think the stop had been requested as part of the tour, but we spent over an hour there. 
	  They even did a "runway" show for us. It was interesting (for 10 minutes or so), but we had to 
	  wait for the one couple who actually bought a coat.</p>
	  <p>We were driven back to town and 
	  dropped off in downtown Kusadasi. We found a ceramics shop and bought an Ottoman 
	  scene on two ceramic tiles. Then it was back onto the ship and a quick workout in the gym. 
	  For dinner I had the braised short ribs. Once again very good! The entertainment was song 
	  and dance, so we went to the hot glass show instead. Once again we didn't win anything.

      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_29.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
 	  <p>Today was a day at sea. We arose to rain! Big surprise! The rain was accompanied 
	  by much thunder and lightening. I was up at 6:00, so I headed right up to the gym while Marj 
	  rested. There were lots of people in the gym, even at so early a time. When I got back to 
	  the room, Marj was gone, so I watched some Corner Gas. Marj returned and we did 
	  breakfast. </p>
	  <p>It was time to do our free laundry, so I packed a bag of dirty stuff and left
	  it for the room steward. Being Elite, we get two free bags (max 30 items) of laundry for
	  the cruise. We didn't do much after that bit of excitement, just 
	  wandered and then attended a lecture on the Pharaohs of Egypt. It was OK. We had lunch 
	  and then popped into the Captain's Club officers' party. Then we read for most of the afternoon. 
	  It was formal night, so I had to don my suit and tie. For dinner I had the lamb chops. We 
	  skipped the entertainment and checked in early as we had a 7:00 AM start the next day.</p>
	  <p>Oh yes, about "Team Earth". This is a room on Deck 7
	  where Celebrity has interactive TV screens 
	  that allow you to see all the wonderful things that they are doing to help the environment.
	  Kind of interesting, but you never see anyone there. Not a big draw!

        <h3>Day 11 (Oct 29) - Haifa, Israel</h3>
      </center>

      <p>We woke early (5 AM) to a sunny, warm morning. We were finally in Israel. We headed 
	  up for breakfast and then watched the docking in Haifa. We could see the beautiful Ba'hai 
	  temple and gardens on the slopes of Mt Carmel. We had decided to do ship's tours
	  in Israel due to (probably unwarranted) safety concerns. 
	  We met at 7:00 for the tour and boarded the 
	  bus to Galilee. As we drove through the city, all the signage was in Hebrew. Unlike
	  Europe, there was very little English in sight. We even passed a McDonalds that had
	  the golden arches, but the name was in Hebrew. Most of the signage was in
	  Arabic as well. Arabic is a second language in Israel, so most of the signs contain
	  Hebrew and Arabic.</p>
	  <p>A short distance out of Haifa we were following a tandem dump truck and the driver 
	  did an illegal pass using a left turn lane. Just our luck, we were 
	  pulled over by an Israeli police woman. That was fun! Dispite a lot of pleading, the driver
	  ended up getting a ticket.
		<br clear=right>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_31.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_32.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>The countryside was quite hilly and barren except for where there was irrigation.
	  We passed by a number of Arab towns. It was easy to pick out the Arab versus Israeli 
	  towns by the architecture. I wasn't aware of the large number of Arabs in Israel
	  (20% of the population). Actually I shouldn't call them Arabs as they are Israeli 
	  - just like French Canadians are Canadian and Afro Americans are American.
	  Their heritage is Arabic, but they are Israeli citizens.</p>
	  <p>Suddenly we travelled over a hill and there 
	  was the Sea of Galilee! It was quite hazy and difficult to make out the far shore, but
	  it was smaller than I had imagined it. Our first stop was at the Church of
	  the Mount of the Beatitudes. It was quite 
	  warm by then, reaching 31C. The church and nearby monastery were very interesting.
	  A Korean tour group (or some Asian nationality) we doing a service in  the
	  church and singing some hymns. 
	  Then we drove to the nearby village of Tabgha to see the 
	  Church of the Multiplication (where 2 fishes and 5 loaves fed the multitudes). There
	  was a rock beneath a table marking the exact spot where Christ gave his sermon.
	  Then it was off to Capernaum (also nearby) to see the ancient Synagog where
	  Christ preached. We also saw the ruins of the house of St. Peter. A number of
	  the 12 apostles were from Capernaum. 
		<br clear=right>

      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_33.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	  <p>Then we headed off north along the shore of the Sea of Galilee in a clockwise 
	  direction, passing through the Golan Heights. It was obvious the military advantage 
	  of attacking Israel from
	  the heights, so it's no wonder Israel annexed this area, At the south end of the sea, we 
	  stopped at the River Jordan to see where St. John the Baptist did his thing. There
	  was a large souvenir shop there and I bought a decorative tile. At this 
	  point it had clouded over and started to rain. The temperature dropped quickly to 
	  about 20C. We headed up the west shore of the sea to a kibutz
	  just past Tiberias for lunch (Ginosar). 
	  The lunch was a buffet in a huge restaurant (seating hundreds) and was quite good.
	  After lunch we left the sea  and headed west to the city of Nazareth. Along the
	  way the rain stopped and it cleared up a bit. We did a drive
	  through of the city 
	  and then stopped at the Church of the Annunciation. The church was huge. It is the 
	  largest Christian church in the Middle East. By now it was 5:00 PM and getting dark. 
	  We drove back to Haifa (about 1 hour) and arrived back at the ship at about 6:00 PM. 
	  Just in time to change clothes and go to dinner. We were missing Dave and Louise as 
	  they were overnighting in Jerusalem on a private tour. After dinner we once again 
	  skipped the entertainment (Brooks Aron who we had seen before) as we had a very 
	  early morning ahead.

      <p>Once again awoke to a sunny morning. It was supposed to be 25C today. 
	  At 8:00 we boarded the bus and headed across the countryside to Bethlehem. 
	   It was about a one hour drive the Jerusalem. Once there, we went through southern 
	  Jerusalem and through a wall (built in 2003) into the Palestinian area (part of the 
	  West Bank). Bethlehem is in the Arab section. If I had realized this when booking 
	  the tour, I might have thought twice about going. However, I wasn't aware of this 
	  until we actually reached the wall. Our Israeli guide had to leave the 
	  bus on the Israeli side and we picked up a Palestinian guide for the arab area.</p>
	  <p>The first difference I noticed after entering the West Bank was that the signage was
	  in Arabic, with lots of English. There was no trace of any Hebrew. The architecture
	  was not all that different than Israeli Jerusalem, but this was because the Bethlehem
	  area was originally Christian, and it is only recently that Muslims have grown to
	  outnumber the Christians.

	  <p>We stopped first at a souvenir store for almost an hour! The guide claimed that
	  the church wasn't open yet, so we waited at the shop. Then it was off to the 
	  Church of the Nativity - built on the site
	  where Christ was supposedly born. The location was a 
	  cave rather than a stable. The church was very large, and there were actually 
	  several churches of different denominations connected together. We had to 
	  enter a grotto to see the supposed (and contested) location of the birth. 
	  Actually, there are two grottos one of which is officially the site of the birth.
	  There was a 2 hour lineup to get in, so we opted to see the other grotto which 
	  had no lineup. As the guide pointed out, no one really knew the exact spot and 
	  the second grotto was just as likely. As the story of the birth was 
	  written a century or more later, the
	  exact spot is highly speculative (if even in Bethlem at all!). We visited several 
	  churches of differing denominations all of which were very interesting..
	  <p>Leaving 
	  the church(es), we drove back to the wall, changed guides and entered the Israeli 
	  section. We stopped for a buffet lunch in a large multi-story
	  building that was empty except for the 
	  dining area. By this time it had clouded over and was raining (dropping to 11C
	  degrees!).

      <p>After lunch we drove to the town center. There we walked into a large plaza 
	  overlooking the Wailing Wall. I put on a cardboard Yamulka and joined the 
	  Hasidic Jews writhing at the wall. Very strange! Then we walked through some 
	  narrow streets and followed the Via Dolorosa (the path of Jesus
	  carrying the cross). This path 
	  travelled through a large shopping bazaar and was very commercial. With the 
	  crowds, the shops and the rain it was difficult to make sense of the various 
	  "stations of the cross". At the top we entered the Church of the Holy Sepulchure 
	  that contained the locations of the crucifiction and the burial tomb. The exact locations 
	  as marked are highly subjective, but I guess it's meaningful to some anyway. 
	  By this time it was almost 5:00 PM and time to head back to the ship. On the way 
	  back we stopped at a location overlooking the Gardens of Gethsemone. We 
	  arrived at the ship just after 6:00, and sailed at 7:00. Once again we skipped the 
	  entertainment as we were tired and had an early start for our Egypt tour.

        <h3>Day 13 (Oct 31) - Luxor, Egypt (Day 1)</h3>
      </center>

      <p>We had a late docking today in Alexandria at 10 AM. This was good though 
	  as we had to pack and get ready for our overnight trip to Luxor and Cairo.It was 
	  forecast for sun and hot - no rain! We left the ship at 10:00 and got onto the bus. There 
	  were about 35 of us on the bus. Our tour guide walked down the aisle asking each 
	  of us our names. Then she walked back up the aisle addressing each of 
	  us by name! For the rest of the 2 days she always talked to us by name. Amazing! 
	  We left the port and drove through the streets of Alexandria. What a different way 
	  of life. We saw people in arab costume, crumbling buildings (at least they appeared 
	  that way) and very dirty streets with garbage. Mixed in with the cars and trucks on 
	  the roads were carts and wagons pulled by donkeys. Yes, we were in Africa! We 
	  soon arrived at the airport. There, we caught a flight to Luxor (about 1.5 hours 
	  away).</p>
	  <p>Arriving in Luxor, we immediately bused to the Valley of the Kings.
	  At the famous valley we got a lecture 
	  from the tour gide and then were given tickets to visit 3 tombs. There are 64 tombs 
	  in total - some being actively excavated, some open for the public and some 
	  temporarily closed. Our ticket allowed us to chose any three of the open tombs. 
	  Our guide recommended Rameses III, Rameses IX and Horemheb, so we went 
	  with her suggestion. The tombs were way underground and we expected it to be 
	  cool there, but it was actually hotter and more humid. The tomb walls were
	  painted with pharaohs and deities, plus lots of hieroglyphics. And, yes, my
	  hieroglyphics course turned out to be well worthwhile as I recognized many of
	  the symbols and words, especially the cartouches of the pharaohs and
	  the deities. Woohoo! After visiting the 3 tombs, we 
	  gathered back on the bus and headed to our hotel to check in and have dinner,
	  stopping along the way at the Colossi of Memnon (statues of Amenhotep III) for photos.

		<p>Dinner was a buffet and quite good.
		After dinner (around 7 PM, after dark) we reboarded the bus and drove 
		to the Luxor Temple which was all lighted up. What an amazing site! The 
		columns and structures were huge. Even though it is much older, it really 
		outdid any of the Roman or Greek temples that we have seen in the past. 
		There were spotlights everywhere, so the temple was really lit up. We 
		walked around the site for about an hour and then headed back to the 
		hotel. We were back by about 9 PM and told that we would be getting 
		a 5 AM wakeup call. The hotel was a five star and was gorgeous. Our 
		room had a large balcony overlooking the Nile River. We stayed on 
		the balcony for a while enjoying the warm air and the lights on the river. 
		There was a large platform on the bank of the river where a dancing 
		show was being performed. What a lovely evening!

        <h3>Day 14 (Nov 1) - Cairo, Egypt (Day 2)</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_46.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_47.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
      <p>Up at 5:00, breakfast at 5:30 this morning. Such a beautiful hotel, but we 
	  arrived and left in the dark! We checked out, boarded the bus and headed 
	  to the Karnak Temple as full daylight came upon us. This temple was even 
	  larger and more amazing than the Luxor Temple. We spent an hour or so 
	  tramping around the temple site before gathering back at the bus. Then 
	  we headed to the airport for our 10 AM flight to Cairo (about 1 hour away). 
	  At Cairo we boarded a bus and drove out to see the pyramids of Giza. 
	  Along the way we travelled through the residential area of town (15 to 20 
	  million people) and it was again a dirty crumbling ghetto. Part of the way 
	  was along a canal where everyone threw their garbage. I even noticed 
	  a dead mule on the bank. One vacant lot looked like a landfill site and right 
	  next to it was a small sidewalk cafe. Phew! I wouldn't want to
	  eat there!</p>
	  <p>Before we had left the residential 
	  area we could see the pyramids. Cairo (actually Giza) has expanded right 
	  up to the pyramids. We stopped at an area where we had a good view of the 
	  three large pyramids. It was quite hazy and the wind whipped up a real 
	  sandstorm at times. There were numerous hawkers there, including a 
	  number offering camel rides. What a zoo! The pyramids were very interesting, 
	  though paled in impact to the temples of Luxor. The bus moved us to three 
	  stops around the pyramids, the last being at the famous sphinx.
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_48.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_49.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290">
	  <p>After walking around the pyramids and the sphinx, we drove to the 
	  Meridian Hotel for a late buffet lunch. Then we drove to the "Papyrus 
	  Institue" shopping mall. There we picked up Polo shirts we had ordered 
	  the day before with our names written as a hieroglyphic cartouche. The 
	  shop was interesting and the papyrus paintings were beautiful but very 
	  expensive ($100's +++). Then we edged through traffic to the National 
	  Museum. We stayed there from 5:00 to 6:30. The highlight was the Tutankhamen 
	  collection, but there were many other interesting items there as well. 
	  Unfortunately, many of the real treasures were looted from the Egyptians
	  in the 1800's by Britain, France and Germany for their museums. It
	  boggles my mind after seeing Tut's exhibit (a very minor pharaoh) of
	  how many museums it would take if all 64 of the tombs in the Valley of the 
	  Kings were intact!</p>
	  <p>Then it was time to head back to the ship. We had a three hour 
	  bumpy bus 
	  ride and reached the ship after 9:30 PM. Our sechduled departure 
	  was 10 PM, but 66 people were still missing from the ship. We popped 
	  into the buffet for a very late dinner. Sometime after 10:00 we finally moved 
	  from the dock. It had been a busy 4 days in Israel and Egypt and we were 
	  looking forward to the next two "at sea" days. 
      <br clear=left>

        <h3>Day 15,16 (Nov 2,3) - Two Days at Sea</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_50.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_51.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>So, after a busy 4 days, we finally had a sea day break. In fact, we 
        were up for two sea days. The rythm was the same in the morning - up early, 
        off to the gym, CornerGas cooldown then to Michael's Club for a smoothie 
        or hot chocolate. The Michael's Club thingy was another Elite perk from 
        8:00 to 10:00 each morning. Then to the buffet for a real breakfast. After 
        breakfast we headed up to the Hot Glass Show. And, Marj actually WON!!! 
        The piece was a floppy bowl shape, made by G Brian. <i>Just a note on 
        G Brian: we were talking to him and I mentioned being on the Solstice 
        in February where the guest artists were Alex and Brenna. Turns out that 
        Brenna is his fiance! What a coincidence!</i> Anyway, our challenge now 
        was to get this huge glass thing home. More on that later. <br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_52.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_53.jpg" align="right" border="0">
	  <p>We really did enjoy the hot glass sessions that we attended. The artists are really gifted
	  and make it look so easy. The two artists on this cruise were a couple of clowns, too, and their
	  continuous banter was sometimes quite funny. But they were also very informative when they 
	  needed to be.</p>
	  <p>Of course, we had to do lunch in the buffet each day. For some reason, we never did do the
	  formal dining room for lunch. Too busy I guess. As usual, I had my favourite egg
	  salad and shredded lettuce in a fresh wholewheat bun.</p>
	  <p>On the first of our 2 sea days we attended an 
	  afternoon classical piano concert with Brooks Aron. It was excellent. We had seen him 
	  play several years ago on the Constellation in the Baltics and just loved him then, too.
	  On the second day
	  we did a lecture on sea legends. It was pretty good, but I found the lecturer to be
	  a bit of a drone (ie. I was sleepy). We had our final formal night and took pictures of
	  our table mates all dressed up. The menu choice was lobster! After dinner we wandered
	  through the "end of cruise" junk sale but didn't buy anything. Neither night had entertainment 
	  that interested us so we just did our own thing. Also, we had to finish up those library books
	  as we wouldn't have any more time for reading. The library was well stocked with books
	  and I had managed to scoop 2 new Dean Koontz books.</p>
	  <p>Oh yes, we also submitted our second laundry bag in time to get our clothes back  on
	  the last full day of the cruise. We needed some clean clothes for Naples,
	  and for our short stay in Rome.

        <h3>Day 17 (Nov 4) - Naples, Italy</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_54.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_55.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>We pulled in to Naples about 6:00 AM and caught the city in the morning sunlight. It was
	  almost completely clear, but the forecast was for heavy cloud. Sure enough, in no time at
	  all clouds started rolling in. This was our second time to the
	  Amalfi coast, and it looked like we were destined to never see it in the sunshine. Sigh!
	  We had an early breakfast and then disembarked the ship to meet our tour guide at 7:00.
	  This tour was set up by Glenys and Alan and there were 8 of us in the van.
	  We've always had great tour guides, but I didn't care for this fellow. The sound system
	  in the van was really poor and Marj and I (in the rear seat) couldn't hear him at times. He also
	  mumbled and spoke with quite an accent. Worst of all he had an attitude that I didn't care for.
	  Enough said.</p>
	  <p>We drove south  along the coast through the city of Naples. Then we came to an 
	  agricultural suburb where the best pasta flour was made (so they say). we travelled (quietly)
	  past Mount Vesuvius, careful not to disturb it.. By this time it was very cloudy and dark -
	  not what we wanted!
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_56.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_57.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>The first stop we made was at an overlook  of the town of Sorrento. I think we stopped at
	  exactly the same spot last time. Anyway, this time we proceeded down and into the town 
	  (last time we bypassed it). We stopped at the Church of St. Francis near the waterfront. It was 
	  a beautiful church. Then we headed a short distance to a shop that dealt mainly in inlaid
	  wood. They had desks, tables, cabinets, etc and done in gorgeous inlaid wood designs.
	  The prices were all in the 1,000's of Euros - a bit much for my budget. Marjorie figured that
	  the shop would use bubble wrap to ship items, so asked if she could have some for her 
	  "hot glass" winning. So, Marj left the inlaid wood shop carrying a large roll of bubble wrap!
	  And it was free! After a stop of about
	  1/2 hour, we headed out on the windy coastal higway again.</p>
	  <p>We eventually came upon our first  coastal village - Positano. The van could take us about
	  halfway down the mountain into the village, but then we had to get out to walk the rest of
	  the way down to the beach. The narrow lanes were lined with souvenir and ceramics shops.
	  We diverted from the main path and visited a large cathedral - Santa Maria Assunta. These
	  churches are squeezed into the surrounding buildings and don't look so big from
	  the outside. However, when you get inside they are huge. We wandered right down to the
	  beach and then headed back up, browsing in some shops along the way. We spent
	  about 1 hour touring the village and then headed back to the highway again.
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_58.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_59.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>Continuing along we passed the village of Praiano, but we didn't stop for a tour. We
	  stopped a little further on at a ceramics factory. The variety of stuff there was amazing 
	  including dining room tables, huge pots, benches, dishware, etc. The patterns were bright with
	  lemons, flowers, village scenes, etc. Beautiful stuff! In the shipping room there were
	  packages lined up for all over the world. But we resisted and didn't buy anything.</p>
	  <p>Then we stopped for lunch at the Calajanara restaurant along the highway. I had some
	  gnocchi and it was very good. After lunch we continued on and stopped for tours of 
	  the villages at Amalfi (on the ocean) and Ravello (up in the hills). We had done Amalfi 
	  before (got our house numbers there), but not Ravello.  I wanted to see inside the Amalfi
	  Cathedral, but there was a 2 Euro charge and I only had $US which they wouldn't take.
	  We stopped for about an hour in each village. I sure wich the sun had been out because 
	  the pictures came out very drab.</p>
	  <p>Then it was time to head back to the ship. We headed up over the mountains and were 
	  enveloped in thick fog until we hit the north side of the mountains. Heading down the mountain 
	  we rejoined the coastal highway and turned toward Naples. We arrived at the ship about 
	  5:30 as it was getting dark. Dispite the weather we enjoyed the trip, but it would sure be nice
	  to do the coast one day in the SUNSHINE!!</p>
	  <p>We headed off to dinner and said goodbye to our dinner mates. We had had such a 
	  great time with them. 4 were staying on for the TA leg, but Barry and Heather and us were
	  departing tomorrow. We went back to our room and packed our suitcases, putting them 
	  out in the hallway for pickup. Time for our final sleep on the ship.

        <h3>Day 18,19 (Nov 5,6) - Civitavecchia and Home</h3>
      </center>

	  <p>Sadly it was debarkation day today. We were being picked up for a tour at 9:30, so had 
	  lots of time to wander and then have breakfast. We headed off just after 9:00 and claimed 
	  our bags in the terminal building. Heading outside we found the tour guide and then waited 
	  for the 4 other folks to show up. It was about a 1 hour drive from Civitavecchia to Ostia
	  Antica (which was very near the FCO airport). The sun was in and out, but it wasn't raining.
	  Ostia Antica is the site of the ancient roman seaport. The ruins there are quite extensive.
	  The guide did not accompany us into the grounds, so we had about 1.5 hours to wander 
	  around on our own. This turned out to be not enough time to do the whole site. It's
	  pretty huge! However, we saw enough of it for one day.
		<br clear=left>
      <img src="images/diary_med_1009/photo_med_1009_62.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <img src="images/diary_china_0507/photo_china_0507_85.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
      <p>A very short distance away was a large medeival castle and the small village of Ostia. The guide
	  took us over to see if we could get into the castle. It turned out that the castle didn't open until
	  12:00 PM, but it was already 11:55 AM. So, we only had a 5 minute wait and then were given
	  a tour of the castle. It was very interesting. After that we did a quick wander about the village 
	  and then stopped at a deli / bar for a sandwich. Then the driver headed to the airport and 
	  dropped Marj and I off at our hotel. The other folks were continuing on to Rome.</p>
	  <p>We had booked the Hilton Garden Inn and it was very nice. We just relaxed for the rest of 
	  the afternoon, rode the bike in the fitness center,
	  and did a short walk around the area. We had dinner at the hotel (I had shrimp 
	  linguini). We did some reading and watched TV. It was an early night as we were booked 
	  for the 5:30 AM shuttle. The next morning we shuttled to the terminal building (about a 10 
	  minute ride). We caught the flight to Frankfurt and from there to Calgary (11 hours!).
	  We arrived in Calgary about noon and Christina was there to take us home. All was 
	  well at home, and we picked up Fluffy from the kennel. It had been a great trip.
