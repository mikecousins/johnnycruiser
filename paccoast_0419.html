      <p>This was a surprising booking (to me) all round. Over the years we had heard plenty of negative feedback 
	  of Norwegian cruises and had vowed never to try one. We also consider a 7 night cuise to be short and either 
	  back-to-back 7 nighters or book a longer cruise. And thirdly, we do appreciate the smaller ships.
	  Well, the surprise was that Marjorie booked a 6 night on the huge Norwegian Bliss. I certainly couldn't
	  complain though as this was our fourth cruise in four months and the Bliss was almost brand new.
	  What made this cruise extra special was that we were accompanied by Marjorie's sister Lynn and 
	  nephew John, and my high school friend Mary. The ship was sailing quite full, with 4530 passengers
	  (double occupany max 4,400).</p>
	  <p>Our stateroom (a mini-suite) was a bit of a shock but wouldn't have been if I had read the description
	  in the literature.
	  We had booked suites a couple of times on HAL and Princess and received balcony cabins that were
	  1.5 or 2.0 times the width of a normal balcony cabin. In this case the cabin was identical in width to a standard 
	  cabin and the "suite" part was actally 4 feet of extra length. This was taken up by the bathroom with a
	  double sink, huge shower and dance floor. So, the fact that we were in a suite was only visible when 
	  in the bathroom.</p>
	  <p>The service onboard was not up to what we had come to expect. Our  "morning" room makeup
	  was often not done until 1:00 or 1:30. One evening makeup was missed - forgotten? In the
	  restaurants I often had to order  my soda several times (especially a refill). And one morning
	  I ordered my usual omelet with "everything" and it came as a a lump of cooked egg with nothing
	  in it! The staff seemed to really care, but maybe they are responsible for too many staterooms 
	  or too many tables.</p>
	  <p>The ship was not conducive to trivia. The sessions were held in the atrium lobby that had
	  theatre type row seating. This minimized the ability to have teams participating.
	  The guest services and shore excursions desks were part of the atrium.. It 
	  was extremely noisy. If you sat in the wings, you couldn't  see the two story screen on which the 
	  questions were projected. Apart from a few teams of 2 it was every man for himself. This was
	  probably the most poorly designed trivia area we have encountered at sea</p>
	  <p>Finally the itinerary was not exotic, hitting ports we were very familar with. This made it an easy
	  cruise with no need to book any excursons. In our younger days of cruising I would have felt 
	  cheated, but now I really enjoy relaxing on the ship. The entertainment was OK. We enjoyed 
	  "The Jersey Boys" (Marjorie saw it twice) but the "Havana" show was loud and unfamiliar so 
	  we only lasted 20 minutes or so.

      We took Rusty in to the kennel in the morning and then headed to Christina's. Along the way
	  we stopped at Subway to pick up our lunch for the airport. Christina dropped us off at the airport about 
	  noon. We checked in and then ate our sandwiches. The flight to LA was at 1:30. It was cold and sleety 
	  outside so we had to wait to be de-iced. This delayed us almost an hour.  We took off as the snowstorm 
	  hit Calgary and the airport was closed later that evening. We arrived in LA about 5:00.
	  The temperature was a blissful 21 degrees. We waited for our hotel shuttle and were transferred to the
	  Crowne Plaza (airport). The first thing we did after checking in was to walk to a liquor store about a block 
	  away where we picked up 4 cans of  Pepsi and some cruise snacks. Then we went back to the hotel to 
	  meet Mary for a sushi dinner. After dinner and some conversation we packed it in and went to bed.

    We were up about 7:00 and met Mary at the breakfast place. Breakfast was not 
    included, but we had a very good breakfast there. A bit later we caught the 
    hotel shuttle to the airport, then boarded the cruise line shuttle bus to 
    the cruise dock. We went through the checkin and were onboard the ship by 
    12:00. <i><b>Note:</b> The security people at the xray area confiscated my 
    four cans of Pepsi. In 77 previous cruises on 10 major cruise lines I have 
    never had this happen. I've brought on soda and/or local beer at many, many 
    embarkation ports and itinerant ports and never had a problem. I don't hide 
    or disguise the drinks and even carry them onboard in the grocery or liquor 
    store bags we purchased them in. I realize that all of the cruise lines have 
    this policy - I guess we have just been lucky.</i> We headed to the buffet 
    zoo and had a bite to eat before locating our room. Our bags arrived shortly 
    after and we put away all our clothes. At 3:30 it was the muster drill and 
    sail-away was at 4:15. Lynn and John arrived at the ship around 3:00, so we 
    didn't meet them until dinner time. We had dinner in the main dining room 
    (MDR). The MDR was actually housed in three separate dining rooms - one large 
    room on deck 7 and two smaller rooms on deck 6. After dinner we wandered the 
    ship and then headed to bed. <br clear=left>

	 Our two sea days were typical of any cruise we have been on. As the Bliss
	 was new to us we spent a lot of time exploring the ship. There were a few things that set it apart
	 from other ships. Firstly there was a 2-deck high go-kart race track on the pool level. It
	 was $10 per ride, which incuded 8 laps of the circuit. The cars were electric (ie. quiet) and the 
	 roar-r-r-r sound was provided by speakers in the crash helmets. Marjorie and I did not try them
	 but John did and said they were a lot of fun.. The 
	 second unusual feature was a twin bowling alley (indoors). It was narrower and only half the 
	 length of a standard lane, and used 5 pin balls and stubby 10 pins. We had breakfast  and
	 lunch each day in the MDR. Omelets for me was the norm. We decided that the larger MDR 
	 was too noisy and prefered either of the two smaller MDRs (same food though). One of
	 the days we attended "The Jersey Boys". They did a very good job of it.

        <h3>Day 3 (Apr 30) - A day in San Francisco</h3>

      We woke up to a beautiful sunny day as we sailed into San Francisco Bay. There was some 
	  morning mist and it was a bit windy, but all in all it was to be a beautiful day. Lynn and John were
	  doing their own thing, so Marjorie and I had a free rein to do what we wanted. We had
	  breakfast in the MDR and then headed off to see SF.  We were docked at Pier 27, about half way
	  along the strip of numbered piers (on "The Embarcadero"). Marjorie wanted to go to See's Chocolates 
	  which meant we had to walk as far  south as Pier 1 and then take Washington Street to Embarcadero 
	  Center. We found the See's shop and were rewarded with a handful of taffy suckers and some free 
	  chocolates to taste. We ended up buying three boxes of chocolates. On our return trip to the ship we 
	  walked along some of the piers - all of them interesting. We reboarded the ship, dumped our purchases
	  had a quick lunch in the buffet and prepared to leave on another walk in the opposite direction.

	  After a fortifying lunch we ambled back out again,  this time headed towards Pier 37 (Fisherman's Wharf). 
	  It was around 1:00 PM by this time.
	  By chance the free Fisherman's wharf shuttle double decker bus was waiting for us a few steps from the ship.
	  We hopped aboard and had a lovely drive past the piers to Pier 39 (Fisherman's Wharf). After exiting the bus 
	  we went for a stroll along the famous pier accompanied by
	  quite a throng of tourists. The shops were boutique style and quite expensive. Marjorie was looking for t-shirts, but they were 
	  too expensive. At the end of the wharf were the famous docks where hundreds of barking sea lions lay in the warm sun.
	  What a racket! We watched the sea lions for quite a while and then walked back to the
	  SF Aquarium building and spent an hour or so wandering through the exhibits. The highlights were the lively river otters 
	  and the jellyfish tank. An excellent aquarium! After leaving the aquarium  it was time to head back to the ship before it left 
	  without us. We decided we had had enough walking and sat waiting for the double decker shuttle to arrive (about
	  3:00). We waited
	  for about half an hour and then gave up and walked back. As we walked back there was still no sign of the bus.
	  We were back aboard by 4:00, time to watch the sail away and get ready for dinner. We had dinner at the MDR with the
	  gang and reported on what we had each done in SF. After dinner (in the MDR) we caught our first entertainment offering
	  "Havana". It was a song and dance spectacle featuring a program created by Norwegian, so we didn't  know
	  any of the music. It was very loud so we only lasted about 20 minutes. We wandered the ship and then went to bed.

      Today we had an unusual docking schedule at Victoria being from 1:00 PM to midnight. 
      So, we had the morning to relax
      and watch the scenery go by (gulf islands). For the afternoon we had arranged 
      with Dave & Joan that they would pick us up about 2:00 and take us to lunch at Il 
      Terrazo restaurant. The 1 hour delay was because, this being the first Canadian 
      port in the cruise, we all had to go through Canada customs before the ship 
      would be cleared for deboarding. Lynn and John had booked a whale watching 
      tour from 3:30 to 6:30, so Dave organized two "sister shifts" - lunch with 
      Marjorie and me, and a late dinner with Lynn and John at 7:00. So, D&J picked 
      us up from the ship and we had a wonderful meal at our favorite Victoria 
      restaurant. Afterwards we walked over to Roger's Chocolates to pick up some 
      treats for the kids. While there, who should we meet but our cruise mate 
      Mary. It was nice because Dave also knew Mary from high school and hadn't 
      seen each other since. We then drove to Beacon Hill Drive-in for an ice 
      cream. Then Dave delivered us back to the ship about 4:00 We walked out 
      the causway to get a great view of out ship. We were not really hungery 
      for dinner, so just did a quick meal in the buffet. After dinner Marjorie 
      went for a second dose of "Jersey Boys" while I stayed back and read. It 
      was a great day and we really appreciated the blue sky and all the spring 
      fllowers. (And seeing D&J of course).

	  It was Vancouver today. Once again our target arrival time was 1:30 PM. The ship ran an interesting route 
	  as we left Victoria at midnight and 
	  had 13 hours to get to Vancouver (the ferry does it in under two hours). The navigation channel showed the ship 
	  doing a large circle in the Gulf of Georgia, tring to kill time. Looking down at the wake it looked like the ship had 
	  stopped. We were up about 7:00 and did our usual sea day things until the afternoon. After lunch, Marjorie, Lynn 
	  and I headed off the ship  to meet Jeanne. It was cool and overcast, not really good for photos. We met Jeanne
	   outside of the terminal building and decided to do a bit of a walk about. We ended up at the Olympic flame plaza 
	   from the 2010 games. As we sat talking Mary walked by so she had a chance to meet Jeanne, the fourth sister.
	   By 4:00 we had to say our goodbyes as Jeanne had to get back to her vehicle parked at the Sky Train, and Lynn
	   had to help John disembark as he wasn't staying overnight. A friend was picking him up. We had dinner in the 
	   MDR and said goodbye to Lynn and Mary. After dinner we went back to our cabin and packed our bags to put 
	   out for tomorrow's disembarkation.

      We were up at 6:30 and Marjorie headed up to the top deck to take some photos in the early morning sun. By fluke
	  she arrived just minutes after two Holland America ships collided. (Oosterdam and Nieuw Amsterdam). One of the 
	  ships was already docked, while the other one was just backing in. Marjorie got some photos of the row of cabins that 
	  were damaged. We headed to the buffet for a quick breakfast.  Our call to disembark came fairly quickly and we
	  headed off the ship to get our bags and leave the terminal building. We had done customs in Victoria, so there were 
	  no delays. We walked the short distance to the canada Line terminus and boarded the train for the airport  We were to
	  the airport by about 10:30, checked in, did security and were at the departure lounge well before our 12:00 flight. It was
	  a quick flight to Calgary. After getting our bags, Chrissy came from the cellphone lot and drove us back to her place.
	  We visited then transferred to our car for the short trip home. We were in time to pick up Rusty from the kennel.
	  It was nice to be home again with the kitties. The cruise was great - lots of visiting.
