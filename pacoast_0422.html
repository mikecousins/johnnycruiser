        </font></p>
      <p>With the Covid-19 pandemic winding down, we decided to try a short cruise to see what post-Covid cruising would be like.
	  It had been almost 3 years since the start of the pandemic. <I><b>Note: </b>The last ship we were on before  the cruise
	  industry shutdown was the Crystal Symphony. This same ship ( and cruise line) was one of the pandemic's early victims
	  and declared bankruptcy during the  lockdown period.)</i> We decided to take a short cruise to test the waters.	  
	  Marjorie found a five day Pacific Coast cruise aboard the Discovery Princess from Los Angeles to Vancouver. 
	  There were just two ports of call (San Francisco 
	  and Victoria) During the pandemic I was diagnosed with Parkinson's so we needed a cruise that wouldn't tax me too much.
	  This met the goal with two short flights and lots of "at sea" time.</p>
	  <p>In order to spread out the travel  hassle we decided to go a day early and overnight in an LA hotel. This worked well and  
	  we had a nice Thursday afternoon in an LA suburb near the airport.  In the afternoon  we did a walk around the hotel area and discovered
	  a wonderful Greek restaurant. I had shrimp kebobs and Marjorie had pastitsio. Yummy!! The next morning (Friday) we shuttled back to the airport to catch the bus to the cruise dock.
	  The ship was brand new (well, two weeks old) and we were delayed a bit in boarding as there was a "naming" ceremony"
	  happening. Lots of big wigs and media on the ship. Once aboard we went to our stateroom and waited for our luggage. Then 
	  we did a short walk aound the ship to see the general layout of things. 
	  <p>The ship seemed rather empty and we discovered  that the ship of 3,660 capacity had only 2,220 passengers for the sailing.
	  That was fine in that we encountered  almost no  lineups or waits anywhere on board. The ship was gorgeous and very familiar 
	  if you have been on any of the "grand class" ships.  I checked out the loyalty club benefits to find that a number of the 
	  benefits had changed from free whatever to 50% off of whatever (at least for "elite" passengers).
	  For example what used to be free internet access was now 50%
	  off of the premium package. This was still too expensive, so we lived with no internet for 5 days.
	  Another ship-wide change was the new electronic door keys. What used to be a door pass card (like a credit card) is now 
	  a digital button on a lanyard. Now when you approach your cabin, the lock senses you several feet away and turns the door
	  handle to green and unlocks the door. No more fumbling with a card. Likewise around the ship the restaurants and shops 
	  all recognize you  as you approach the restaurant entrances or shop cash registers. No more needing a keycard lanyard 
	  that is of sufficient length (and availability) to reach the card reader - any length lanyard will do, even under clothing!
	  <p>Another change was to the daily event guide. It is now just a single page listing events and restaurant times. Gone
	  was the daily info pages that gave interesting info on our ports of call, weather forecast, bios of nightly entertainers, etc. 
	  We really missed the daily info. Also 
	  gone is the ship's library. In the olden days they had actual librarians and a wonderful library. This has shrunk  over the years
	  to smaller self-serve library and now it is gone all together. We didn't attend any of the entertainment, but touring ourselves through
	  the theatre showed that the front section of the guest seating was flat and only the balcony section was slanted. This meant 
	  the lower seats provided a great view of the heads in front!
	  <p>On our sea days, we wandered the ship and participated in several trivia sessions, generally just enjoying ourselves.
	  At San Francisco (a beautiful sunny and warm day), Marjorie headed ashore and did the HoHo bus while I just stayed on board
	  reading my book and playing trivia. Marjorie had a great time on her tour and I enjoyed myself just vegging. We had
	  a late stop in Victoria (sched for 1 PM docking, 8 PM sailing)) but docked even later due to heavy seas and high winds 
	  through the previous night. We eventually docked about 3:30 and
	  Joan & Dave were there to greet us. We hopped in their car and drove to Il Terrazo 
	  in downtown Victoria for an early dinner. Wonderful! Then Dave 
	  took us on a driving tour of the Beacon Hill area before dropping us off back at the ship. So great to see D&J again!
	  <br>

        <h3>Day 6 (May 4) - Disembarking in Vancouver</h3>
      </center>
      <p>We arrived in Vancouver at the Pan Pacific about 6:00 AM. It was cool and cloudy.  We had
	  breakfast and then went to wait for our turn to leave the ship. We got the call about 9:00. Our
	  bag was waiting in the terminal area and we went through Canadian customs.  We had
	  a short walk from the dock to the Canada Line station. The train was right there, so we were 
	  at the airport in about 1/2 an hour. There, we walked to the arrivals level and caught the van 
	  to the long term parking. We were in our car by 2:00 PM.
