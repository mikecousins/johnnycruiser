      <p>We booked this cruise at the last minute as Marj received notification of a really good deal. We had already
	  planned a short driving visit to Vancouver, so were able to work the cruise in to our schedule with just a single flight
	  required from Vancouver to San Diego. Marj passed on the info to Dave and Joan, who decided to join us on the 
	  cruise.</p>
	  <p>The Century had been refitted since we were on her in 2005. Lots of balconies had been added and public 
	  spaces were somewhat re-arranged. We were surprised at how small the staterooms were. The previous time we had 
	  had a family suite. This time our regular ocean view cabin was very small.

      <p>We left Calgary about 8:00 AM.  As we drove through the Banff area, we were hit with a real blizzard.
	  It wasn't until we got to Field that it started to clear up.  We ate lunch in Golden and arrived at Liz and Jim's
	  in Summerland at about 3:00 PM. Liz had arranged for dinner at the Sumac Ridge golf course. It was very
	  good. The next morning we did a drive around Summerland to see what had changed, and stopped
	  in at Summerland Sweets.  We left Summerland about 10:30 and headed over the connector. We
	  stopped for lunch in Merrit and then did the Coquihalla. The traffic was heavy heading into Vancouver and 
	  we arrived at the Fairmont Airport about  5:00 PM. We hopped on the Canada Line and then the
	  Seabus and walked the two blocks to Kevin and Tricia's new penthouse condo. We had a very nice dinner
	  with them and enjoyed seeing their new condo. What a great view. We caught the 9:45 Seabus and got back 
	  to the hotel by 10:30 PM. </p>
	  <p>The next day we drove down to Bellingham to do some shopping. We didn't buy much but enjoyed the trip.
	  We popped back to the hotel mid-afternoon to change and then picked up Lynn from work and drove out
	  to Jeanne's for dinner. Nice to get together again! We drove Lynn home and finally arrived back at the hotel 
	  after 10:00 again. The following morning (it rained all day),
	  we drove around Richmond checking it out and then headed into 
	  Coquitlam to do Me'N'Ed's Pizza. Yummy! We spent the afternoon passing by our old house in Coquitlam
	  and Liz's empty lot on Regan. We toured around Maple ridge and spent some time in a small mall. We 
	  arrived at Barb and Paul's for dinner about 5:00 PM. It was so nice to see their whole family again. It
	  was a long drive back to the hotel, and we got back about 11:00 PM.  We had to drop the car off
	  at long term parking and then grab the shuttle to the terminal building and hotel. We would leave the car
	  in long term until the end of our cruise.Three late nights, but we had had 
	  a really enjoyable time visiting with relatives and friends.

      <p>This morning was brighter out. Our flight was at 9:00 AM, so we took our time packing and checking 
	  out of the hotel. We walked to the departure checkin and did security and US customs. Our flight 
	  was on time and we landed in San Diego just after 11:00. During the flight we passed over Mount St. 
	  Helens, which is where we would be several days later on a port stop at Astoria. D&J 
	  showed up a bit later to pick us up. They had rented a Ford SUV, so we had lots
	  of room. We went directly to the hotel to check in (D&J had already 
	  been there a day). The hotel was nice (but not fancy) and was not near to anything. After
	   checkin we headed off to do lunch (at In'n'Out) and some shopping. We bought a few things (like
	   Coke for the cruise) and enjoyed walking in the sunshine. That evening we dined 
	  at Pat & Oscars - chicken and ribs. We finished off with a swim in the hotel pool. There
	  was no hot tub, but the pool was fine.

	  <p>The next day we had breakfast at the hotel and then drove into town to Balboa Park. 
	  It is a huge park (1,200 acres), larger than Stanley Park (1,000 acres). We
	  spent the morning doing the Air and Space Museum which was amazing. There was
	  a special exhibit about the space program, including the return module from the
	  Apollo 11 mission. We had lunch at a 
	  sandwich bar. Afterwards I headed to the model train museum while the rest went elsewhere. 
	  The HO train setups were huge. On the largest of the displays, it took a train over an hour to 
	  do a complete loop! There was a section of mountain scenery that was 8 feet tall from the river 
	  valley to the mountain tops, with some fantastic wooden trestles and tunnels.
	  We had to leave mid-afternoon as we had a date to meet some friends 
	  (Kathie and Craig) from San Diego that we had met on our previous Beijing cruise. We drove
	  over the bridge
	  to Coronado Island to meet them at 4:30. We had dinner at L'i'l Piggy's - chicken and ribs.
	  Afterwards we drove across the island to the Del Coronado hotel and spent the evening
	  exploring the hotel grounds. Then it was good-bye to K&C and back to the hotel
	  for the night. Marjorie did some laundry, then we packed for the cruise.

      <p>We didn't get up too early as we had lots of time to get to the cruise dock. It was a cool
	  and partially cloudy day. We had breakfast,
	  then Marjorie checked us out and we loaded our suitcases into Dave's SUV. We drove to the cruise
	  dock and Dave let Marjorie and I and all the luggage off on the pier. D&J took the SUV back to the 
	  rental place (nearby) and walked back to the pier. Marjorie took the opportunity to run
	  across the street to an ATM for some $US. </p>
	  <p>When we were all together again, we entered the terminal building and went through the checkin 
	  procedures. We were aboard by 11:30 or so, but weren't allowed to our rooms until 1:00 PM.  We 
	  towed our carry-on stuff and headed to the buffet for lunch. Then we wandered the ship for a while 
	  and settled in some deck chairs on the upper deck. The announcement finally came to open the 
	  rooms so we hustled to our cabins and stowed our carry-on. Our luggage appeared later and
	  was unloaded into drawers and closets. I sent my two formal shirts in for a "free" pressing. Yeah
	  for being Elite! The muster drill was at 4:30 and we left the dock soon after. I had prime rib for dinner.
	  We skipped the entertainment and went to bed early.

	  <p><b>Day 2</b> - Today was cold and rainy. We were up early and I went directly to the gym. I
	  discovered a spa cafe next to the gym that made wonderful yogurt / granola cups, with fresh fruit
	  on the bottom. Also, there was an Elite-only lounge each morning that made awesome smoothies. 
	  Often I would grab a yogurt cup from the spa and then carry it down to the lounge for a smoothie
	   accompanyment. Marj would come with me for company and then we would do the buffet 
	   breakfast (more her style).
	  This ship hosted 6 trivia sessions each day, each one with a different theme. 
	  We certainly didn't make all of them, but we did 2 
	  or 3 most days. Anyway, it was a typical sea day. It was dressup night tonight.
	  For dinner I had rack of lamb. The entertainment 
	  was song and dance, so we skipped it.

	  <p><b>Day 3</b> - Today was our first port day in San Francisco. We would 
        be there overnight and tomorrow as well. We didn't have an excursion booked for the first day,
		so decided to walk around the downtown. After breakfast we opted to do the early trivia and
		Marj and I actually won! Of course, there was only one other team so the odds were pretty good.
		Then we headed outside into a cloudy and cool day.
		We were docked at pier 27, so it was about a 20 minute walk to the famous Pier 39. We
		had done the pier before so didn't walk into the throngs of people milling around the stores
		and restaurants. From there, we headed north to Ghiradelli Square. Again this was about a 
		20 minute walk.We browsed the shops at the square, but they were really expensive. The 
		Ghiradelli chocolate shop was more expensive than buying their same treats in a local
		grocery or drug store.

	  <p>We stopped at an information stand and got directions to Union Square and then back to the ship.
	  We caught the nearby #30 bus and were taken right to Union Square. Again we browsed around 
	  some shops and then  hit John's Grill for a seafood lunch 
	  (sole stuffed with crab and shrimp). It was very good. While we were in
	  the restaurant, it poured in rain. By the time we were done, the rain had ended, so we just had to 
	  look out for puddles. We hopped on the "F" trolley which took us back to the maritime area and 
	  we got off at Pier 23 (the closest stop to our ship). It was only a short walk back to the ship, and we
	  arrived at about 2:30. I went up to the gym and then tried another trivia. For dinner 
	  I had shrimp and scallops on risotto - very good. The entertainment was a comedian who did
	  wonderful impressions and sound effects.

	  out to the bus for 8:30. The bus trip to the Napa Valley was about  1.5 hours.  We arrived at
	  the train station and went inside for a wine tasting, and to browse the souvenier shop. We 
	  boarded the train about 11:30. The track  was 25 miles long, from Napa village to St. Helena
	  and the round trip would take about 2.5 hours. Our tour group were boarded directly onto a 
	  dining car, and soon after leaving the station we were served a wonderful meal. I had the prime rib
	  (thin slice) and it was excellent. It was raining as we toured along the valley, but we were warm 
	  and dry inside. At the turning point in St. Helena, we switched train cars with another group so 
	  that they could dine on the way back. We moved into a salon car where we were served desert.
	  It was wonderful passing by all the vinyards and chateau buildings, but it would also have
	  been nice to actually tour some of the wineries.</p>
	  <p>We arrived back at the station for a brief last chance to browse the souvenir shop and then 
	  boarded the bus for the journey back to the ship. We arrived back about 4:00 PM. It had been
	  a great day. For dinner I had sole stuffed with shrimp. We did the Beattles trivia with D&J, and 
	  tied with three other teams at 100%. Didn't do the entertainment.

        <h3>Days 5,6 (May 18,19) - At sea, then Astoria</h3>
      </center>

      <p><b>Day 5</b> - Our second sea day of the cruise was cold (54 degrees) but sunny. I went
	  up to the gym right away (7:00 AM). The gym never seemed to be too busy on this cruise, and
	  most people there were actually using the equipment. Afterwards I grabbed my favorite yogurt cup 
	  from the Spa Cafe and a smoothie from the Elite lounge.
	  We did the various trivia sessions and then played Hand & Foot with D&J in the afternoon. For dinner 
	  I had corvina (a white fish). The entertainment was a musical couple 
	  (called Kimika) - the lady sang and the fellow played
	  a mean rock guitar. The music was far too loud. The singer was OK, but the guitar player was excellent.
	  He played some Eagles stuff plus even a couple of classical music tunes. Awesome!</p>
	  <p><b>Day 6</b> - The next day we arrived in Astoria about 8:00 AM. We had breakfasted ready for 
	  our tour when we watched the ship come into harbour. The channel was quite dangerous, so instead 
	  of a pilot boat, the pilot was brought onboard via helicopter. It was cool out, but with sunshine and blue skys.

      <p>We caught our bus at 8:30 and drove along the Columbia River to Longview where we turned north, 
	  crossed the river, and headed into Washington State. Our guide on the bus was excellent
	  and kept us informed and entertained as we drove. After about 1.5 hours we were at Mount St. Helens.
	  Our first stop was at the Forest Learning Center. It was too early in the season for the center to be 
	  completely open, but they opened the souvenir shop and we picked up our box lunches there.</p>
	  <p>Then we continued closer to the mountain, past the Coldwater Center to the Johnston Ridge 
	  Observation Center. The view of the mountain was awesome. We were looking right into the huge 
	  crater. Some puffs of steam could be seen against the blue sky. The park ranger gave a very
	  good talk about the history and natural history of the mountain and surrounding area. After 
	  about an hour of browsing the center we reboarded the bus and retraced our path back to the
	  ship. We arrived at the ship by 3:30, which was good as the ship was leaving at 4:00 PM.
	  It was formal night. I had lobster, shrimp and scallops for dinner. The entertainment was song 
	  and dance, so we skipped it.

      </center>

	  <p>We woke up this morning to a gorgeous sunny day. The temperatures ranged from warm to hot.
	  I was up early and did my gym workout before breakfast. We weren't due to arrive in Nanaimo until 11:00 AM, so 
	  we had time to do a trivia session. We were out in the atrium ready to disembark 
	  at 11:00 when an announcement 
	  came over the PA for several people to report to the purser's desk. Canadian customs was interviewing
	  a small random selection of passengers in order to clear the ship. Every 10 minutes or so another
	  announcement  was given for one specific passenger who obviously didn't show up for the interview.
	  At one point the announcer reminded the missing passenger that he was holding up the entire ship from 
	  going ashore. Finally, about an hour late, we were given permission to leave the ship. We found out 
	  later that the missing passenger was having a spa treatment where the PA system was not available.
	  So, he had no idea that anyone was looking for him.

	  <p>Leaving the ship, we exited onto a brand new cruise dock built by the city to attract cruise ships.
	  Unfortunately 2011 would only see 4 ships here. We were the second and two more were expected 
	  in September and October. I hope that cruise stops catch on here as it is a beautiful area with lots 
	  of interesting places to visit.
	  Our ship's tour took us on a drive through the city of Nanaimo, and then out into the country to a
	  wine and cheese farm near Parksville (Morningstar Farm). It was a dairy farm where 
	  all of the milk produced was turned into cheese (Little Qualicum Cheeseworks). 
	  They had another operation on the side making fruit wines (Mooberry Winery). 
	  We were given a tour of the wine and cheese
	  facilities and had several wines and cheeses to taste. Then we did a "hay ride" tour of the farm.
	  Finally we went through some barns and stalls to see some of the animals. After
	  the tours, we were served a BBQ lunch in the sunshine. Bliss!

		<p>After our lunch we loaded up on the bus again and drove a short distance to the village of Coombs
		where we stopped at a market place. Now, this 
		market place was huge. Coombs is a small town, but this market
		had permanent buildings and a real variety of items for sale. We were particularly impressed with the
		international food store that had grocery goods from all over the world. There was also a deli / bakery
		with fresh made pizzas, flatbreads, salads and bakery goods. The parking lot was full of cars, so people
		must come up from Victoria. Two of the large stores featured huge woodcarvings from around the
		world, and one even had an outdoor display of statues. It was like a sculpture market in Indonesia.
		One of the restaurants had a sod roof and there were three goats up on top keeping the grass trimmed.</p>
		<p>After an hour of browsing, we boarded the bus and drove back to the ship. What a wonderful outing!
		We arrived at the ship about 5:00 PM. I had a petit fillet for dinner. The entertainment was a ventriloquist
		and he (and his dummies) was just excellent. He had an amazing talent and was very funny.

      <p>Today was Victoria, our final port for the cruise. It was cool and cloudy with showers. Dave & Joan
	  were disembarking the cruise here rather than carrying on to Vancouver and having to find their
	  way back to Victoria. We had breakfast and wandered off the ship about 9:00 AM. The bus that 
	  picked us up from the Ogden Point dock happened to pass by within a couple of blocks from D&J's 
	  house. We did a quick stop at their house and then Dave drove us to the Butchart Gardens. 
	  It was cheap to get in as D&J had season's passes and Marjorie was free for being a
	  travel agent. Only I had to pay and I got a 10% discount as a guest of D&J.
	  Can't beat that! It was tulip
	  season and the gardens were beautiful. There were beds of every kind and colour of tulip
	  imaginable. Their were shrubby plants like forget-me-nots and
	  British daisies mixed in with the tulips providing
	  a colour contrast. The rhodies and azaleas were in various stages of flowering - some almost over
	  and some still just buds. There were also a few beds of later daffodils, but most were already done.
	  Despite the occasional showers of rain, the gardens were amazing. We really
	  enjoyed our walk through the park.

	  <p>After a couple of  hours in the gardens, we hopped back in Dave's car and drove back to the ship.
	  It was about 1:00, so we all went to lunch. D&J had to have their stuff off the ship by 2:00, so after lunch 
	  we each grabbed a bag and carted D&J's stuff out to the car park. D&J did the Canada customs
	  thing and we said goodbye to them. It was still cloudy and cool, so Marj and I went back aboard and I
	  went up to the gym. We did a trivia session and then got ready for dinner. It was strange not
	  sitting with D&J for dinner. I can't remember what I had. During the late afternoon and evening three
	  other cruise ships arrived in Victoria - Norwegian Pearl, Oosterdam, and Sapphire Princess.
	  The entertainment was a pot pouri of previous
	  shows with the comedian and the ventriloquist that we had enjoyed before doing short acts. 
	  It was very good. We packed our stuff and put our suitcases out in the hall just before bed.

      <p>We arrived in Vancouver at the Pan Pacific about 8:00 AM. It was cool and cloudy.  We had
	  breakfast and then went to wait for our turn to leave the ship. We got the call about 9:00. Our
	  bags were waiting in the terminal area and we went through Canadian customs.  We had
	  a short walk from the dock to the Canada Line station. The train was right there, so we were 
	  at the airport in about 1/2 an hour. There, we walked to the arrivals level and caught the van 
	  to the long term parking. We were in our car by 10:30. We stopped at the Chilliwack White
	  Spot for lunch. Then we did the Coquihalla to Kamloops and over to Salmon Arm by
	  mid-afternoon. It was warm and sunny by now. The Prestige Inn was very nice - right 
	  on the water where there was a wetlands 
	  area. We had a lovely walk around the lakeshore.</p>
	  <p>The next day we drove back through the Rockies to Calgary. It was cloudy with some 
	  sun early in the day, but pouring with rain when we hit Calgary. A huge contigent of bicyclists
	  were along the roadside near Field. Must have been a special program. Anyway, we were home
	  again after another wonderful trip.
