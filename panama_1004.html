      <p>This was a cruise of firsts for us. It was our first time through the 
        Panama Canal. It was our first 14 day cruise. It was our first cruise 
        on Royal Caribbean. And, it was our first cruise where we met a number 
        of fellow cruisers <i>before</i> the cruise, on Cruise Critic. <br>

        <h3>Day 1 (Oct 24) - Boarding in San Diego</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_01.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>We booked our air through the cruise line, so this is the first time that we've flown in on cruise day.
	  Usually we're a day early. The traffic from the airport to the cruise dock was horrendous. It
	  took us at least an hour in the bus to travel about a mile or so. Could have walked it
	  faster. When we got to the cruise terminal, people were lined up outside the building in a huge lineup.
	  It was very hot, too. Our bus parked by a large door and we went right in. However, there was
	  a huge lineup inside as well. It must have taken us over an hour to go through the
	  check-in lineup. This was the slowest embarkation that we've been through.</p>
	  <p>I usually by a 12 pack of Coke on our normal pre-cruise "shopping" day. However, being a 
	  14 day cruise, and arriving the same day as embarkation, I bought a 24 pack in Calgary
	  and packed it with me (as carry-on). After standing in line over an hour with the 24 pack, I though
	  I was going to lose the use of my right arm. But I certainly appreciated it during the cruise!</p>
	  <p>Once on board, we dumped our stuff in our room and headed off to the buffet for lunch.
	  Then we checked out the ship. What a beautiful ship.

        <h3>Day 2 (Oct 25) - A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_02.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>The ship had some interesting furnishings throughtout. The deck layout maps at the
	  elevator banks were wonderful. They were done on thick glass and included a silhouette of
	  the ship sliced from top to bottom that showed the deck levels. Flanking this (on both sides)
	  was a deck layout showing where everything was on that particular deck.</p>
	  <p>In case you couldn't remember what day it was, the floor of each elevator had a 
	  large removeable panel that displayed the day of the week (ie. "Monday", etc). They must 
	  have changed the panels at midnight, because the next morning, there was the new day of the week.</p>
	  <p>We had a Cruise Critic meeting in the afternoon where we met about 30 people that we had
	  corresponded with on the Web previous to the cruise. We were to become good friends
	  during the cruise.
      <br clear=left>

        <h3>Day 3 (Oct 26) - Cabo San Lucas</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_03.jpg" align="right" border="0">
<p>We arrived at Cabo just after sunrise. Having done the tour here on a previous cruise, 
	  we decided not to do an excursion this time. Instead, we just waited for the crowds to depart
	  (tendering site) and then headed in to town. We walked up and down the streets checking 
	  out the souvenir shops, restaurants, hotels, etc. The dock area is always interesting with
	  lots of fishing boats, brown pelicans and white herons.</p>
	  <p>It was quite a hot day, so we spent the afternoon lazing around the ship and looking
	  at the scenery from our balcony. Still haven't done a trip around Los Arcos yet. 
	  Maybe next time.

        <h3>Day 4 (Oct 27) -  A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_04.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>Another sunny day to enjoy floating on the sea. The Radiance has two snooker tables that have 
	  some sort of gimble leveling system. Now all they need is a bowling alley! The Schooner Bar is
	  a beautiful area. Lots of gorgeous woodwork and all of the artwork and sculpture is done in a nautical theme.</p>
	  <p>RCCL seems to be the only line that still has a fitness program aboard. The program is called
	  "Shipshape". You get  shipshape dollars by doing the walk-a-mike on the top deck, joining in on sports events (basketball,
	  shuffleboard, etc) or taking the sit-to-be-fit classes. It was a lot of fun, and we earned enough dollars for 2 t-shirts 
	  and a really handy RCCL backpack.</p>
	  At the front of the ship is an adults-only pool area called the Solarium. It is done in an African safari theme,
	  including elephants, a panther and jungle noise coming from hidden speakers. It was a beautiful area.
        <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 5 (Oct 28) - Acapulco, Mexico</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_05.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
 	  <p>Acapulco is a huge city of some 3 million people. We arrived early in the 
	  morning and headed off on a ship's tour. We travelled through the tourist part of Acapulco
	  and arrived at the cliff diving site. We stopped for an hour or so to watch the divers. It was great.
	  There were 6 or 7 divers, 4 of which dove together. they dove from a height of about
	  125 feet.  The water at the bottom didn't look all that deep. I guess they know what they're doing!
	  After visiting the souvenir shop at the dive site,
	  we drove along the hilly coast overlooking the "Black Lagoon". Saw lots of movie
	  star homes. Our last stop was at a fancy hotel. It had beautiful grounds and boasted the 
	  longest swiming pool in the world (about a mile long).</p>
	  <p>On the way back, the tour guide explained the meaning of the name Acapulco, 
        of which the "co" part meant place or town. He mentioned a number of names 
        ending in "co" - Acapul<b><font color="#669933">CO</font></b>, Mexi<b><font color="#669933">CO</font></b>, 
        Huatul<b><font color="#669933">CO</font></b>, Tampi<b><font color="#669933">CO</font></b>. 
        Someone at the back of the bus shouted out &quot;Cost<b><font color="#669933">CO</font></b>&quot;.</p>
      <p>We headed back to the ship for lunch and spent the afternoon on board. It was quite hot out and
	  we didn't wish to head out to the shopping area.
		<br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 6 (Oct 29) - Huatulco, Mexico</h3>
      </center>
     <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_06.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	 <p>We arrived in Huatulco about 10:00 in the morning. It is a fairly new port for cruise ships. There isn't much there - just a small
	 village with a typical cruise shopping mall. We didn't do an excursion there, we just walked around the town and
	 along the beach. The beach is right off the cruise ship pier, so its easy to get good shots of the ship from the beach. The
	 water was quite murky in this bay, so snorkelling wasn't an option. Some friends went to the next bay for snorkelling and 
	 said it was excellent.</p>
	 <p>We had lunch on the ship and spent the afternoon aboard the ship. The Radiance has a very nice gym which
	 included a rowing machine. I did my 40 minute rowing workout every day. At home I do an hour workout, so 40
	 minutes is kind of a treat.
	  <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 7 (Oct 30) - A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_07a.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_07b.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>We really enjoyed the promenade deck on the Radiance. It did not
	  completely wrap around on one deck. There were stairs at the bow and you
	  had to climb up a deck  where the bow opened up to a helicopter landing
	  pad. The promenade was very wide, so walking was easy.</p>
	  <p>The "lobby" area in the middle of the ship was called the Centrum. It
	  was very large and 8 decks high! The largest we had seen before was
	  only 3 or 4 decks high. At the very top, forming the Centrum ceiling, was the 
	  future cruises office with a glass floor that looked down 8 decks to the floor 
	  of the Centrum. They had almost continuous live music (instruments, singers)
	  there which could be noisy at times.
	  <br clear=right>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 8 (Oct 31) - Puntarenas, Costa Rica</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_08.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>We arrived at Puntarenas just after sunrise. We had booked an all day excursion.
	  We drove through the countryside to the Corobici River. There, we boarded a number of Zodiac
	  boats and rafted down the river for about an hour or so. It was very interesting as we saw
	  small crocodiles, howler monkeys, bats, iguanas, storks and other bird life. After the
	  rafting, we went to a country restaurant that was surrounded by tropical gardens and some zoo animals.
	  Had an excellent meal there (chicken and rice) and then drove back to the ship. The
	  countryside was very interesting.</p>
	  <p>The town of Puntarenas seemed very impovershed.  Once we got back to the ship, we
	  decided to stay on board rather than walking around the town.
 	  <br clear=left>
      <center>
        <h3>Day 9 (Nov 1) - A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_09.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>Another day at sea. Can't really remember what we did this day, so I'll mention the previous evening.
	  It was Hallowe'en and about a third of the folks had brought costumes with them. It was
	  fun seeing so many people dressed up. The culinary staff had done some beautiful pumpkin
	  carving in the Windjammer and other areas of the ship were decorated with witches, bats, spiders,
	  etc. </p>
	  <p>We have come to depend on the ship's internet facilites to keep in touch with the kids back home.
	  On this cruise, the ship lost internet connectivity from Acapulco until we hit Aruba (about  8 or 9 days).
	  The ships crew gave various explanations, depending who you asked. It was a real pain
	  not being able to communicate with the kids. This is the only time we have had that happen.
	  The really annoying thing was often when you asked, rather than saying it was down, they suggested
	  that you try it. Then you had to go to the purser's desk to reverse the charges. Not a good
	  way to handle it.
	  <br clear=right>

        <h3>Day 10 (Nov 2) - Panama Canal and Cristobal Pier</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_10.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>This was the day we had all been waiting for, and it proved to be very interesting. At sunrise,
	  we passed close to the capital - Panama City. Then we sailed under the "Bridge of the Americas" 
	  and into the canal. We went through the Mira Floras locks (double locks) and then the Pedro Miguel locks (single lock),
	  raising us about 85 feet above sea level. The locks were fascinating as we were pulled through by donkeys (small trains),
	  and raised up via water pressure.
	  Then we headed through the narrow canal until we hit Lake Gatun. 
	  There, we let off passengers who were doing excursions and sailed around the lake waiting for our
	  turn to traverse the exit locks (Gatun Locks, a triple lock). There were maybe a dozen or so ships
	  ahead of us (mostly freighters). We finally went through the locks into the Atlantic Ocean.
	  The folks that were let off for excursions joined us again at Cristobal Pier.</p>
	  <p>We had a 4 or 5 hour stop at Cristobal Pier, which was really just a huge cruise ship mall. They did have
	  a lot of colorfully dressed Panamanian natives doing traditional dances, so it was interesting. After visiting
	  the pier, we headed back to the ship for dinner.
  	  <br clear=left>

        <h3>Day 11 (Nov 3) - A Day At Sea</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_11.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>We sailed along the north coast of South America towards the island of 
        Aruba. Every so often you could spot the shoreline of SA in the distance. 
		Our days at sea tended to follow a pattern: 
		<ul>

        <h3>Day 12 (Nov 4) - Oranjestad, Aruba</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_12.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>This was our first visit to Aruba.  We pulled into port just after sunrise.
	  We had booked a snorkelling excursion which departed soon after we 
	  had docked. We did a bus ride along the southern coast of Aruba, passing a
	  huge de-salination plant along the way. We stopped at a ferry dock where
	  we boarded a small ferry for De Palm Island. The boat ride was about 
	  15 minutes and we landed at a lovely little island. Just after we arrived, the sky blackened
	  and it poured in rain. However, it soon cleared up again, and we spent the rest of the
	  morning snorkelling
	  in a fairly shallow area (about 10 feet deep). There were lots of fish there, especially 
	  parrot fish. Our excursion included lunch at a restaurant on the beach. It was a
	  wonderful day.</p>
	  <p>After returning to the ship, we wandered around the town of Oranjestad. It
	  is a quaint city with lots of pastel colored buildings. We really enjoyed Aruba.

        <h3>Day 13/14 (Nov 5/6) - Two Days At Sea</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_13.jpg" align="right" border="0"> 
	  <p>It is a long way from Aruba to Miami, so we had a final 2 days at sea.
	  We made the most of it enjoying the ship and the great weather. I had brought along
	  the DVD of the first season of Corner Gas. My routine was to do a 40 minute 
	  workout in the gym, and then return to my cabin and watch a 1/2 hour episode
	  of Corner Gas while I cooled down. There were 13 episodes on the DVD so
	  they lasted me the entire cruise.</p>
	  <p>We really enjoyed our dinner mates each evening. We were at a table for 6, 
	  but only 2 couples were assigned there. The other couple only showed up for the
	  first night and then decided they preferred the buffet. That's the last we saw of them.
	  However, another couple didn't like where they were seated and on the second
	  evening were moved to our table. We had a great time with them and still
	  keep in touch.

        <h3>Day 15 (Nov 7) - Miami and Home</h3>
      </center>
      <img src="images/diary_panama_1004/photo_panama_1004_14.jpg" align="left" border="0"> 
	  <p>We pulled into Miami at sunrise.  This was our first time at the Miami docks. All
	  of our other Caribbean cruises had been from Ft. Lauderdale or San Juan. There
	  were a number of cruise ships there - it is quite a large docking facility. To
	  one side of the docking area we could see the RCI head office, with separate
	  buildings for Celebrity and RCCL.</p>
	  <p>This was the strangest disembarkation we had experienced. We were
	  waiting in the lounge for our color to be called, when they called all the
	  colors at once. We stood in a very slowly moving queue for about an hour 
	  or so until we reached the baggage area of the terminal. They have carousels
	  there just like an airport. One of the conveyors was broken, so the baggage
	  took forever to come. Not a nice way to end a cruise.</p>
	 <p>The ship, and everything about it was just wonderful. A five star ship
	 indeed! The only negatives about the cruise were the embarkation and debarkation
	 - both the most painful we have experienced, and the internet outage for 9 days.
