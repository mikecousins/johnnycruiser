      <p>Marjorie has had a "free" graduation cruise offer hanging around for several years after completing 
	  an online Princess T/A course.  This cruise especially interested us so Marjorie finally cashed in her 
	  chips. I say "free" graduation cruise because it actually just covered the base price of an inside cabin
	  for T/A and spouse. 
	  On top of the $0, we opted to pay an upgrade charge to a balcony cabin, plus field the
	  taxes and fees. But still it meant a very cheap cruise. The whole point of the graduation cruise concept 
	  was to allow the T/A to experience the ship as an Elite passenger (15 cruises or 150 cruise days)
	  with all the Elite benefits. However, as Marjorie was already Elite, this was a nice but
	  useless gesture. As for me, being as I was on a "free" ticket, my own Elite status was
	  revoked and I was catagorized as a first time cruiser (the dreaded blue card) but with
	  20 cruises under my belt. Figure that one out! So I lost out on free laundry, free internet
	  and some free presentations and parties. The free bar fridge setup was per cabin,
	  so nothing was lost there.
	  As it turned out Marjorie's internet was sufficient for both of us. We used the self-serve 
	  laundromats and probably would have skipped the parties anyways. So no big
	  loss.
	  </p>
	  <p>The only committment for Marjorie was filling in the answers to several sheets of 
	  questions about our cruise. This involved attending events 
	  throughout the cruise or talking to the ship's personnel
	  to find out specific details about our cruise (ie. "how many marriages were performed 
	  on our cruise?" and "How many bottles of champagne were used in the champagne 
	  waterfall event?"). She must have answered them all correctly as we were not tossed 
	  from the ship.
	  </p>
    <p>The ship was full (2205 pax, double occupancy of 2145). Although a recent 
      refit in 2015 added 40 or so cabins foregoing public space, we didn't find 
      the ship overly crowded. We had no problem getting seats in the theater, unlike the 
	  Grand Class ships. The only strange casualties of the refit was squeezing the
	  fitness center into a dark closet on deck 6, surrounded by cabins, and blocking off
	  the aft promenade deck with new cabins preventing a continuous walk around
	  the ship. Overall we enjoyed the ship though.
	  </p>
	  <p>A number of items contradicted our usual behaviour on a cruise:
	  <ul>
	  <li>Against our usual better judgement, we flew down to the cruise on embarkation day. 
	  Normally we fly a day ahead, and overnight in a local hotel - just in case. Sure enough
	  we almost missed out connecting flight in Seattle due to delays in Calgary.
	  <li>I decided to have a complete rest from my rowing regimen and didn't do the gym once 
	  in 15 days. I didn't miss it and was able to pick right up again when we returned home.
	  On the other hand I didn't miss a single meal.
	  <li>We had 7 sea days and 6 port days. We only booked two excursions and both of 
	  them were afternoon outings. Hence we never had a single day where we had to be 
	  up by a certain time.
	  <li>As noted above I lost my Elite privileges which really didn't hurt. In fact I had a
	  delightful time showing my "blue card" with twenty cruises logged! (Princess puts
	  the number of past cruises in the lower right corner of the cruise card).
	  </ul>
	  But then you have to mix it up so that each cruise is memorable.

       <h3>Pre-cruise / Day 1 (Nov 10, 11) - Travel to LA and boarding</h3>
      </center>
    <img src="images/diary_panama_1117/photo_panama_1117_01.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
     Our flight to LA (through Seattle)
	 was at 6:00 AM, so we decided to overnight at the airport. Marjorie checked with
	 the brand new Marriott and scored a $49.00 T/A rate. Woohoo!  So
	 at 6:00 PM the night before the cruise we drove to 
	 Christina and Matt's to drop off the car and beg a ride to the airport. They dropped us at the hotel 
	 about 8:00 PM  and we did a quick explore then set our alarm for 3:30 AM. and went to bed. It
	 would have been nice to have had the time to enjoy the hotel, but we had to be at the airline
	 checkin by 4:00. Then it was through security and US customs preclearance.  The lines
	 moved very quickly and we were at the departure gate with plenty of time to spare. We had a 
	 very tight connection time in Seattle so were hoping the YYC flight would be ontime. Sure enough when
	 we were loaded they decided to de-ice the plane. We lost more than half an hour (oh, oh). The flight
	 to Seattle picked up some time. At Seattle we had to take a train to another terminal but
	 fortunately this was all within the secured area so we didn't have to repeat security. Even so 
	 the plane was already loading when we got  to the gate. Our flight to LA was ontime and we
	 arrived in LA about  10:30. Lots of time! We retrieved our luggage and then found the Princess 
	 lady to join the bus ride to the cruise dock.
		<br clear=left>
    <img src="images/diary_panama_1117/photo_panama_1117_02.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="350" height="290"> 
	 We bused to the cruise dock (San Pedro)  and arrived at the ship about 12:00.  
	 Check-in was fairly quick and we were soon aboard the ship. We immediately
	 inquired about lunch served in the Main Dining Room (MDR) and were told "Yes". So, we 
	 dumped our carry-ons in our cabin and headed to the MDR. We had sidestepped the buffet 
	 crowds and landed in a peaceful venue that few passengers are aware of (on embarkation day).
	 Note that not all cruise lines provide this service. After returning to our cabin our luggage was 
	 delivered. We unpacked and put everything away. Muster drill was at 3:30. Afterwards 
	 Marjorie was wandering about the ship and ran into Jim and Vickie, our trivia team mates from 
	 our previous Caribbean Princess cruise of the British Isles in June. What a pleasant surprise!
	 Now we had a trivia team for the coming cruise. We had "anytime" dining  and decided (as 
	 always) to go down to the MDR between 5:30 and 6:00. For dinner tonight I had prime rib. 
	 Cruise lines always seem to serve prime rib on embarkation day. It was very good.
	 We were too tired to make the entertainment as it had been a long day. The clocks
	 went forward an hour tonight. That was fine because we would be back on Alberta time.

       <h3>Days 2, 3 (Nov 12, 13) - 2 days at sea</h3>
      </center>

     On the first sea day we were up at 7:00 and had breakfast in the MDR. We attended a 
	 lecture on the upcoming Mexican ports. On most sea days there were 3 trivias throughout 
	 the day. The 12;15  trivia was the "progressive" version, accumulating points on the 
	 seven sea days. We were second place as of the first sea day and remained so 
	 thereafter.  At least we were consistent. In our free moments, we sat and read, and 
	 also wandered the ship trying to answer some of Marjorie's Princess homework.
	 It was a formal night so I donned my sweater and tie - no issues there. I had
	 broiled shrimp. Yummy. We played "majority rules" trivia then headed to bed.
	 The clocks went ahead an hour for the second night in a row.
	 <p>The next day was a 7:00 start again with breakfast in the MDR. We spent
	 the day alternating trivia sessions with periods of reading or wandering. For
	 dinner I had rock fish (unusual choice for me) which was very good. The 
	 entertainment was a couple of guys - one a singer and one a cello player. They
	 were wonderful! They both also played piano very well. And, as a bonus, I knew 
	 almost all of the music. A top notch performance!!

    We were up at  7:30 to watch us dock in PV. This was our fourth or fifth time here,
	so had nothing planned for the day. We had breakfast in the MDR before 
	heading out into the heat to wander the town and perhaps get some beer.
	Phew, it was hot and humid. (Think of Calgary and it's not so bad!). We headed 
	across the main street and there was Wal-Mart, shimmering in the heat. We
	quickly popped inside for some free A/C and then settled our account by 
	buying a six-pack of  Modelo beer and some peanuts.
	Then it was back to the ship. As usual, we had no problem
	carrying the beer aboard, always expecting the security check 
	people to confiscate it, but it never happens. Maybe they were distracted by 
	the peanuts. (I wonder if there is an award for most beer stops without
	confiscation - we must have brought beer back aboard at several ports for each 
	of 60+ cruises. The only time we haven't raided the local beer stores is the 
	odd cruise that has been "liquor included". We were back in time for 2 of the 
	trivias and, of course, lunch. We read between trivias. For dinner I had chateaubriande
	which was very good. We skipped the entertainment,
	wandered the ship and went to bed.

       We were up at 7:00 and Marjorie headed right down to use the internet 
	   computers for her T/A business. Afterwards we had breakfast in the MDR. 
	   We lounged around most of the day (it was a sea day) and squeezed in 
	   some trivia sessions. For dinner I had braised short ribs. Delicious. We
	   skipped the entertainment.
	   <p>The next day we were up at 8:00 as we docked in Huatulco. We had
	   been here before and noticed a new shopping  area, but otherwise not 
	   much around. We had breakfast in the buffet, played a session of trivia, and
	   headed off the ship to explore the small town. It was very hot and humid.
	   We wandered around the shops for a while, stopping at an outdoor shop 
	   (snorkeling, etc) where Marjorie used the wi-fi. (The sales lady
	   was from Vancouver!). We wandered back onto the ship for lunch.
	   Back onboard we walked around the ship and then settled for a read 
	   on the promenade deck. For dinner I had lamb shank. Too big, but it was
	   very good. The singer/cellist duo were on again in the theater with a new show so
	   we just had to go. Once again they were excellent, we really enjoyed them.
	   We wandered the decks then went to bed.

	  (In fact, both of us had forgotten that it was formal night). For dinner I had

    <p>The next day, we were up at 7:30 as we anchored off of San Juan Del Sur, 
      Nicaragua. This would be a new country to us as we had never stopped in 
      Nicaragua before. We had signed up for an afternoon excursion, so had the
	  morning to ourselves. We breakfasted in the MDR, then read and trivia'ed the morning away. 
	  After our lunch in the buffet, we tendered to shore to meet our 12:45 excursion. The
	  bus left at 1:00 to the small village of Rivas where we visited the lovely 
	  San Pedro Cathedral. Then we drove to the Amoya River which we
	  followed to a botanical garden on the shores of Lake Nicaragua. At the 
	  gardens we had some local fruits and drinks, and were treated to some native 
	  dancing. Guess who got pulled up on stage to make a fool of himself? Oh well, 
	  I'll never see any of those people again! We drove back to the tender dock (by 4:00). 
	  Halfway back to the ship the tender boat stopped. We had to wait for a repair 
	  crew from the ship to tinker with the engine and get it running again. We were
	  back onboard by 5:00, so didn't miss dinner. I had roast beef and Yorkshire 
	  pudding. We skipped the entertainment and did our own thing instead. I
	  am glad we made it to Nicaragua, but I wouldn't go there again. The people
	  are very poor and are just recovering from a civil war (Contras and Sandinistas).
	  There didn't seem to be any tourism infrastructure yet. Hopefully that will come!

       With no sea day between ports, we were up at 7:30 to watch the docking at 
	   Puntarenas, Costa Rica. We had been here several years ago and enjoyed a 
	   countryside excursion, so had booked an afternoon tour to see more. As
	   usual we had breakfast in the MDR. Our goal for the morning was to walk into town
	   and get some local beer. We asked for directions and it was 7 or 8 blocks to the store.
	   It didn't look good as we walked through the town as it was  Sunday and all the 
	   stores seemed to be closed. We finally made it to a liquor store and it was open!
	   We picked up some "Imperial" beer, supposedly brewed in Costa Rica. It
	   was very hot and humid so we decided to head back to the ship. Plus it was 
	   almost lunch time. We took a different route back to the ship and passed 2 
	   or 3 liquor stores that were much closer to the ship. Maybe the guy who gave 
	   us directions sent us to a family business. Once again we whizzed through
	   security with the beer - no problem. Lunch was in the buffet 
	   today as we had  to hustle to our 12:45 tour.

	   Our bus took us overland to a jungle park on a
	   river where we clambored into sightseeing boats  to see huge crocodiles
	   and many species of herons and water birds.   We saw several giant
	   crocodiles sunning themselves on the shores, and a few more mostly hidden 
	   by the muddy waters . Each of them had been named by the guides - Osama Bin Laden, 
	   Mike Tyson, Madonna, etc. The water birds seemed  to be at ease with the big crocs,
	   often standing quite close to them. Apparently the river is rich in fish, so the 
	   crocs are rarely hungry. The variety of water birds was amazing - mostly new to us.
	   After an hour or so on the river, we were bused to the terminus of a tourist railroad.  We
	   did a 45 minute journey through the woods, which wasn't too scenic. The railcars
	   rocked (dangerously, to me) from side to side due to the uneveness of the tracks.
	   I think that boating through crocs was much more interesting. In fact our journey to 
	   find beer in the morning was more interesting. We arrived back at  the ship
	   by 6:00 PM, so it was getting dark. For dinner I had seafood skewers with salmon, white fish,
	   shrimp and scallops. Afterwards we did the evening trivia and went to bed. We
	   put our clocks an hour ahead tonight which made it seem that we were going
	   to bed at a more daring time.

	  We were up at 7:00 for another relaxing sea day. We ate in the MDR. 
	  Later in the morning 
	  we attended lectures on the Panama Canal and on Cartagena (our next port).
	  We also fitted in a regular  morning trivia session as well as our progressive trivia. 
	  We always seemed to get second place for  the progressive sessions with the 
	  same team beating us, so we weren't picking up any ground. But it was fun. We
	  had a nice lunch in the MDR and spent the afternoon playing trivia and reading.
	  For dinner I had diver scallops. Yummy. We played evening trivia and then went to bed.
    <p><i><b>Note:</b> I should mention that eating breakfast and/or lunch in 
      the MDR could be a long, but pleasurable, process. The meal itself is easily 
      an hour and we often met interesting people and continued talking at the 
      table for at least another half hour. A few times the servers were making 
      up the tables for the next meal when we left.</i> </p>

    The next day we woke up at 6:00 AM at the entrance to the Panama Canal. After 
    10 days of sailing we were finally at the "raison d'etre" of the cruise. It
	was going to be a hot, humid day. We 
    decided to have a quick buffet breakfast. However, when we got there most 
    of the tables were taken by onlookers, due to the great forward facing view 
    from the restaurant. So we grabbed some food and carried it back to our cabin 
    to eat there with our balcony view. This was our second time through the canal, 
    so we were most interested in seeing the new expanded section. From the old 
    locks (the Miraflores locks) we could see the water storage tanks of the new 
    route and the top of a ship passing through. The new locks are a triple lock 
    system with the 85 foot total lift being done in one go. The old locks have 
    a double lock system and a single lock system separated by a couple of kilometers. 
    Hence, for that portion between the lock systems, the new canal is at a slightly 
    higher elevation than the old. 
	<p><i><b>Note:</b> Small train engines called "mules" (or "donkeys") hook 
      up to the ship, 4 on either side. Contrary to popular belief, they are not 
      used to pull the ship through the locks. The ship's engines provide the 
      thrust to proceed into or out of a lock. The mules instead provide a lateral 
      force that keeps the ship from hitting the side walls of the lock.</i>

      By 9:00 AM we had cleared the locks and were heading down the Culebra Cut towards 
	  Lake Gatun. At the lake we cued with other ships for the final triple lock (Gatun Locks)
	  and out to the Atlantic Ocean. The previous time we were here in the lake, lots of people 
	  tendered off the ship for nearby excursions. They were picked up several hours later at San Cristobal
	  pier. This time there were no excursions provided. We waited a couple of hours in the lake
	   and then proceeded out of the canal and off to Cartagena, our next port. In the original
	   itinerary we were scheduled to stop in Aruba (that would be nice!) but it was deleted
	   due to the Zika Virus scare. As we left the canal we could see the city of Colon (to the left). 
	   We had docked there a few years ago on a cruise that didn't do the canal (ie.
	   not on the itinerary). It was
	   the day after a period of heavy rains and flooding so bad that the canal was
	   actually closed for the day (trees and other junk floating in the water). Lucky
	   we weren't scheduled for a transit!
	   We played afternoon trivia and read some then headed for dinner.
	   For our daily repast I had roast beef. Very good. Afterwards we played evening trivia.
	   We skipped the entertainment, instead wandering the ship and then headed to bed.
	   We had really enjoyed the canal transit.

      We were up at 7:00 as we docked in Cartagena, Colombia. It was another
	  hot and humid day. We had been here once before (several years ago), so had not
	  signed up for an excursion. We had a leisurely breakfast in the MDR.  Afterwards we
	  left the ship to wander the dock area. They had added a small zoo near the dock 
	  since we had last been here. The tourist shopping area was now surrounded by
	  flamingos, peacocks, parakeets, rabbits and 3 or 4 species of small monkeys.
	  There were no structures to enclose the animals, so the care and feeding must 
	  have been sufficient to keep the animals around. We wandered the zoo area until 
	  we had had enough of the heat, and went back on board in time for morning trivia.
	  Then we read for a while before going to lunch in the buffet.  The ship was ready to 
	  leave at 1:30 PM as we had a long way to go to Grand Cayman. We read, wandered
	  and played afternoon trivia, which whiled away the afternoon. For dinner I had 
	  sea scallops. Love that seafood! We skipped the entertainment , wandered a bit
	  and then went to bed.

     Another sea day began as we arose at 7:00. We had breakfast in the MDR. The morning
	 was consumed by reading, wandering and joining in trivia. The morning also featured the
	 staff putting up Thanksgiving decorations throughout the ship. They did a great job and
	 the ship was quite festive. Lunch was also in the MDR. In the afternoon we spiced up
	 our usual wandering and trivia with a performance of the passenger choir. These were
	 27 passengers with a passion for singing who had spent a couple of hours a day practicing 
	 for the final performance. The were very good. It was formal night (3rd one) and I had

	 gear with us and sure enough Eden Rock was too choppy for safe snorkeling (for the 
	 third time in a row!). This was our first Caribbean cruise where we didn't do any snorkeling!
	 We did an up-and-down of the main street and then pulled into a liquor
	 store to buy some special rum for some cruising buddies back home. We reboarded the ship 
	 and had lunch in the buffet. We spent the afternoon as usual - reading, wandering and trivia'ing.

      We were up at 7:00 for our final sea day. We have had a lot of sea days this cruise, 
	  but we have enjoyed them all. It was cooler out today, mainly because we were 
	  leaving the hot humidity of the Caribbean behind us as we sailed towards Fort
	  Lauderdale. We had breakfast in the MDR and enjoyed a good visit afterwards. 
	  Wandering around the ship there was no trace of all the Thanksgiving decorations 
	  from the day before. It was like it never happened! For the morning we filled it with
	  wandering, reading and morning trivia. We did lunch in the buffet as we had to 
	  hustle to 12:15 progressive trivia, our final game of the series. Once again we
	  were second, ending up second overall for the 7 sea days. It had been fun.
	  After trivia we pulled out the suitcases and started our packing. We squeezed
	  in afternoon trivia, but discovered that we had already packed our thinking caps.
	  We didn't do as well without them! It was time to say goodbye to our trivia buddies.
	  For dinner I had roast beef. We finished our packing leaving us in the clothes

     We were up about 6:30 to watch us docking in Fort Lauderdale. When Marjorie 
	 booked this cruise, we failed to realize that it ended on the Sunday of the American 
	 Thanksgiving - the heaviest (and most expensive) travel day of the year. (We
	 have done this before, you'd think we would learn!). So, she
	 saved a bundle by booking us to stay over night in FLL and fly out on the Monday.
	 We disembarked about 9:00, picked up our bags, went through US Customs and
	 boarded a van to the car rental facility (at the airport). We drove to the Gallaria Mall  and
	 had lunch at P.F. Chang's (Marjorie's favorite). Then we spent the afternoon 
	 wandering around the mall. At dinner time, we checked into our hotel.
	 Marjorie took the rental car back and caught the hotel shuttle to return
	 to the hotel. In the evening we walked around the neighbourhood as
	 the darkness overtook us. The next morning we caught the shuttle to the airport
	 for our lengthy flight itinerary - FLL to SFO, three hour layover, SFO to SEA, three 
	 hour layover, and SEA to YYC where we arrived just after midnight. C&M had
	 parked our car at the airport parking lot the previous night , so we could
	 drive directly home. All was OK at home and the kitties were glad to see us.
